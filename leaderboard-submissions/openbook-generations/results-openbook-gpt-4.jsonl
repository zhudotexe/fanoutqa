Delta is a founding member of the SkyTeam airline alliance. As of the end of 2022, it had 90,000 employees.\n\nDelta has nine hubs, with Atlanta being its largest in terms of total passengers and number of departures.

{"id": "f63815bef563916d", "answer": "The languages of China are diverse with several hundred languages being spoken. The predominant language is Standard Chinese, which is based on Beijingese. There are hundreds of related Chinese languages, collectively known as Hanyu, that are spoken by 92% of the population. The Chinese languages are typically divided into seven major language groups. They differ as much from each other morphologically and phonetically as do English, German and Danish, but share the same writing system (Hanzi) and are mutually intelligible in written form. There are approximately 300 minority languages spoken by the remaining 8% of the population of China. The ones with greatest state support are Mongolian, Tibetan, Uyghur and Zhuang.\n\nEnglish has been the most widely-taught foreign language in China, as it is a required subject for students attending university. Other languages that have gained some degree of prevalence or interest are Japanese, Korean, Spanish, Portuguese, and Russian. During the 1950s and 1960s, Russian had some social status among elites in mainland China as the international language of socialism. In the late 1960s, English replaced the position of Russian to become the most studied foreign language in China. After the Reform and Opening-up policy in 1988, English was taught in public schools starting in the third year of primary school. Russian, French, and German language classes have been made widely available in universities and colleges.

Only buildings with continuously occupiable floors are included, thus non-building structures including towers, are not included. \n\nAs of 25 January 2024, this list includes all 93 buildings (completed and architecturally topped out) that reach a height of 340 metres (1,120\u00a0ft) or more, as assessed by their highest architectural feature. The building is considered as architecturally topped out when it is under construction, structurally topped out, fully clad, and the highest finished architectural elements are in place.\n\nOf these buildings, almost half are in China. Six of the last seven buildings to have held the record as 'tallest building' are still found in the list, with the exception being the North Tower of the original World Trade Center at 417 metres (1,368\u00a0ft) after its destruction in the September\u00a011 attacks of 2001. If the Twin Towers were never destroyed, and One World Trade Center was never built, the WTC towers would rank 35 and 36 on the list today.\n\nThe international non-profit organization Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat (CTBUH) was formed in 1969 and announces the title of \"The World's Tallest Building\" and sets the standards by which buildings are measured. It maintains a list of the 100 tallest completed buildings in the world. The organization currently ranks Burj Khalifa in Dubai as the tallest at 828\u00a0m (2,717\u00a0ft). However, the CTBUH only recognizes buildings that are complete, and some buildings included within the lists in this article are not considered finished by the CTBUH.\n\nHistorically, the world's tallest man-made structure was the Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt, which held the position for over 3800 years until the construction of Lincoln Cathedral in 1311. The Strasbourg Cathedral in France, completed in 1439, was the world's tallest building until 1874.\n\nThe first skyscraper was pioneered in Chicago with the 138\u00a0ft (42.1\u00a0m) Home Insurance Building in 1885. The United States would remain the location of the world's tallest building throughout the 20th century until 1998, when the Petronas Towers were completed.

{"id": "8efeec69fa2e4f1c", "answer": "The Columbia-class submarine, formerly known as the Ohio Replacement Submarine and SSBN-X Future Follow-on Submarine, is an upcoming class of nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines designed to replace the Ohio-class of the United States Navy. The construction of the first submarine began on 1 October 2020 and it is scheduled to enter service in 2031. The first boat will be named USS District of Columbia (SSBN-826).\n\nThe Columbia class is to replace the Ohio class of ballistic missile submarines, whose remaining boats are to be decommissioned, one per year, beginning in 2027. The Columbia class will take over the role of submarine presence in the United States\u2019 strategic nuclear force. A total of 12 submarines are planned, and construction of the lead boat began in 2021. Each submarine will have 16 missile tubes, each carrying one UGM-133 Trident II D5LE missile. The submarines will be 560 feet (170.7 m) long and 43 feet (13.1 m) in diameter, as long as the Ohio-class design, and 1 foot (30 cm) larger in diameter.\n\nIn March 2016, the U.S. Navy chose General Dynamics Electric Boat as the prime contractor and lead design yard. Electric Boat, which built all 18 Ohio-class submarines, will do most of the work on all 12 Columbias, including final assembly. Huntington Ingalls Industries\u2019 Newport News Shipbuilding will serve as the main subcontractor, participating in the design and construction and doing 22 to 23 percent of the work.\n\nThe total cost for District of Columbia would reach $15.03 billion, which includes planning costs for the entire program. As of April 2023, the estimated construction cost of the twelve-boat program is $132 billion. Securing the supply chain and maintaining a skilled labor force are two major challenges for the program.", "question": {"id": "8efeec69fa2e4f1c", "question": "What are the names of the five most recently commissioned ships in the active class of U.S. ballistic missile submarines, and when did the states they are named after gain statehood?", "necessary_evidence": [{"pageid": 187255, "revid": 1176761670, "title": "Ballistic missile submarine", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballistic_missile_submarine"}, {"pageid": 22654, "revid": 1184456224, "title": "Ohio-class submarine", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio-class_submarine"}, {"pageid": 18130, "revid": 1185281832, "title": "Louisiana", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana"}, {"pageid": 33611, "revid": 1183567918, "title": "Wyoming", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyoming"}, {"pageid": 19977, "revid": 1185426430, "title": "Maine", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maine"}, {"pageid": 25410, "revid": 1185930580, "title": "Rhode Island", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhode_Island"}, {"pageid": 21647, "revid": 1182933087, "title": "Nebraska", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebraska"}], "categories": ["History", "Geography", "Military Studies"]}}

{"id": "754dd1bb2013f2fa", "answer": "The economy of South Korea is a highly developed mixed economy. By nominal GDP, \u20a92.24 quadrillion (US$1.72 trillion), it has the 4th largest economy in Asia and the 12th largest in the world. South Korea is notable for its rapid economic development from an underdeveloped nation to a developed, high-income country in a few generations. This economic growth has been described as the Miracle on the Han River, which has allowed it to join the OECD and the G-20. South Korea remains one of the fastest-growing developed countries in the world following the Great Recession and the COVID-19 recession. It is included in the group of Next Eleven countries as having the potential to play a dominant role in the global economy by the middle of the 21st century.\n\nSouth Korea's education system and the establishment of a motivated and educated populace were largely responsible for spurring the country's high technology boom and economic development. South Korea began to adapt an export-oriented economic strategy to fuel its economy. In 2019, South Korea was the eighth largest exporter and eighth largest importer in the world. The Bank of Korea and the Korea Development Institute periodically release major economic indicators and economic trends of the economy of South Korea.\n\nHowever, South Korea is facing a turning point in its economy in 2023. With the constant growth of Mainland China\u2019s manufacturing industry and the impact of COVID-19, South Korea\u2019s manufacturing is experiencing a consistent decline in the manufacturing industry. According to SP Global, South Korea\u2019s manufactured goods export to Mainland China, South Korea\u2019s one of the biggest trading partners, had decreased by 4.4% in the fourth quarter of 2022 and 31.4% in January 2023. On the other hand, their primary electronic manufacturing industry is also facing a downturn. While information and communication technology maintained 34.1% of South Korea\u2019s total 2022 exports, at the end of the year, it decreased to 23.6%.

{"id": "635febde0c76ff66", "answer": "George Henry Dern (September 8, 1872 \u2013 August 27, 1936) was an American politician, mining man, and businessman. He co-invented the Holt\u2013Dern ore roasting process and was United States Secretary of War from 1933 to his death in 1936. He also served as the sixth governor of Utah for eight years, from 1925 to 1933. Dern was a progressive politician who fought for tax reform, public education, and social welfare. He was the grandfather of actor Bruce Dern and great-grandfather of actress Laura Dern.\n\nDern entered politics in 1914, running on a Democratic and Progressive fusion ticket in a Utah state senate district encompassing Salt Lake County. He was elected in 1914, serving until 1923 in the state senate, where he was twice selected as the Democratic floor leader. His tenure there was marked by strong advocacy of progressive legislation, including a landmark mineral leasing act that leased, rather than sold, Utah's mineral rights to private concerns.\n\nAs governor, Dern focused on using Utah's rich natural resources to develop the state economy and devoted himself to education, social welfare, and tax reform, thus further embroidering his reputation as a progressive. Arguing that the general property tax was unfair as the sole source of state revenue, Dern secured the adoption of a state income tax and a corporate franchise tax against strong opposition.\n\nDern served as Secretary of War during a rather inconsequential time period for that position. The country was in the midst of the Great Depression, and due to the financial crisis, had adopted an isolationist approach toward foreign policy. After years of tight military budgets and an isolationist foreign policy, the War Department was a relatively inconsequential post during Dern's tenure. While he was generally well liked by other members of the cabinet, he never played a decisive role in the determination of administration policies.", "question": {"id": "635febde0c76ff66", "question": "What were the birth years of Franklin D.

{"id": "c38f032a4c2db6a2", "answer": "The economy of Russia is a mixed economy with state ownership in strategic areas of the economy. Market reforms in the 1990s privatized much of Russian industry and agriculture, with notable exceptions in the energy and defense-related sectors. Russia is rich in natural resources, being a major exporter of oil, natural gas, and metals. The rapid growth of disposable income and GDP in Russia between 2000 and 2012 was largely driven by high oil prices, but these gains were distributed unevenly, with the 110 wealthiest individuals owning 35% of all financial assets held by Russian households. \n\nIn recent years, Russia's economy has faced numerous challenges, including sanctions imposed by the West due to Russia's annexation of Crimea and involvement in the War in Donbas, which led to a decline in the Russian ruble and sparked fears of a financial crisis. Despite these challenges, Russia's economy managed to grow by 0.6% in 2014, and as of 2023, Russia has a record low unemployment rate of just 3 percent.\n\nHowever, the Russian economy is also characterized by a low involvement in global value supply chains and a focus on raw material production. The country's import dependence is relatively low, which could be due to the low involvement of the Russian economy in global value supply chains and its focus on production of raw materials. \n\nIn terms of technology, Russia is one of the few countries in the world with a homegrown internet search engine, Yandex, which is used by 53.8% of internet users in the country.", "question": {"id": "c38f032a4c2db6a2", "question": "Who are the top 5 oil producers and what is the Gross Domestic Product (PPP) of each?", "necessary_evidence": [{"pageid": 17756493, "revid": 1183601008, "title": "List of countries by oil production", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_oil_production"}, {"pageid": 3434750, "revid": 1185914171, "title": "United States", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"}, {"pageid": 25391, "revid": 1185169928, "title": "Russia", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia"}, {"pageid": 349303, "revid": 1185594377, "title": "Saudi Arabia", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia"}, {"pageid": 7515928, "revid": 1185532020, "title": "Iraq", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq"}, {"pageid": 5405, "revid": 1185706762, "title": "China", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"}], "categories": ["Economics", "Geography"]}}

{"id": "e4989cc27f12f0ae", "answer": "Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is the brightest natural object in the night sky after the Moon. It is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty and is the only planet named after a female figure. Venus is often called Earth's \"sister planet\" because of their similar size, mass, proximity to the Sun, and bulk composition. It is also radically different from Earth in other respects. It has the densest atmosphere of the four terrestrial planets, consisting mostly of carbon dioxide. The atmospheric pressure at the planet's surface is 92 times that of Earth's. Venus is by far the hottest planet in the Solar System, with a mean surface temperature of 737 K (464 \u00b0C; 867 \u00b0F), even though Mercury is closer to the Sun. Venus is shrouded by an opaque layer of highly reflective clouds of sulfuric acid, preventing its surface from being seen from space in visible light. It may have had water oceans in the past, but these would have vaporized as the temperature rose due to a runaway greenhouse effect. The water has probably photodissociated, and the free hydrogen has been swept into interplanetary space by the solar wind because of the lack of a planetary magnetic field.\n\nVenus's surface is a dry desertscape interspersed with slab-like rocks and periodically refreshed by volcanism. The planet's surface was mapped in detail by Project Magellan in 1990\u201391. The ground shows evidence of extensive volcanism, and the sulfur in the atmosphere may indicate that there have been some recent eruptions. However, the lack of evidence of lava flow accompanying any of the visible caldera remains an enigma. The planet has few impact craters, demonstrating that the surface is relatively young, approximately 300\u2013600 million years old. Venus has some unique surface features in addition to the impact craters, mountains, and valleys commonly found on rocky planets. Among these are flat-topped volcanic features called \"farra\", which look somewhat like pancakes and range in size from 20 to 50 km (12 to 31 mi) across, and from 100 to 1,000 m (330 to 3,280 ft) high; radial, star-like fracture systems called \"novae\"; features with both radial and concentric fractures resembling spider webs, known as \"arachnoids\"; and \"coronae\", circular rings of fractures sometimes surrounded by a depression. These features are volcanic in origin.\n\nMost Venusian surface features are named after historical and mythological women. Exceptions are Maxwell Montes, named after James Clerk Maxwell, and highland regions Alpha Regio, Beta Regio, and Ovda Regio. The latter three features were named before the current system was adopted by the International Astronomical Union, the body that oversees planetary nomenclature.\n\nThe Venusian orbit is slightly inclined relative to Earth's orbit; thus, when the planet passes between Earth and the Sun, it usually does not cross the face of the Sun. Transits of Venus occur when the planet's inferior conjunction coincides with its presence in the plane of Earth's orbit. Transits of Venus occur in cycles of 243 years with the current pattern of transits being pairs of transits separated by eight years, at intervals of about 105.5 years or 121.5 years\u2014a pattern first discovered in 1639 by the English astronomer Jeremiah Horrocks.\n\nThe Venus symbol (\u2640) is a depiction of a circle with a small cross beneath it. The symbol is historically associated with the Roman goddess Venus or the Greek goddess Aphrodite. In modern times, it is often used to represent the female gender.", "question": {"id": "e4989cc27f12f0ae", "question": "When were the planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, and Jupiter first recorded in human history, and in which centuries or millennia?", "necessary_evidence": [{"pageid": 19694, "revid": 1183949157, "title": "Mercury (planet)", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(planet)"}, {"pageid": 32745, "revid": 1185890721, "title": "Venus", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus"}, {"pageid": 2068726, "revid": 1185517826, "title": "History of Earth", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Earth"}, {"pageid": 14640471, "revid": 1184868366, "title": "Mars", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars"}, {"pageid": 38930, "revid": 1185658145, "title": "Jupiter", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter"}], "categories": ["History", "Astronomy"]}}

{"id": "227358917da47be5", "answer": "Microsoft is a multinational technology company that develops, manufactures, licenses, supports, and sells computer software, consumer electronics, personal computers, and related services. Its best-known software products are the Microsoft Windows line of operating systems, the Microsoft Office suite, and the Internet Explorer and Edge web browsers. Its flagship hardware products are the Xbox video game consoles and the Microsoft Surface lineup of touchscreen personal computers.\n\nThe company was founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen on April 4, 1975, to develop and sell BASIC interpreters for the Altair 8800. It rose to dominate the personal computer operating system market with MS-DOS in the mid-1980s, followed by Microsoft Windows. The company's 1986 initial public offering (IPO), and subsequent rise in its share price, created three billionaires and an estimated 12,000 millionaires among Microsoft employees. Since the 1990s, it has increasingly diversified from the operating system market and has made a number of corporate acquisitions, their largest being the acquisition of LinkedIn for $26.2 billion in December 2016, followed by their acquisition of Skype Technologies for $8.5 billion in May 2011.\n\nAs of 2020, Microsoft is market-dominant in the IBM PC compatible operating system market and the office software suite market, although it has lost the majority of the overall operating system market to Android. The company also produces a wide range of other consumer and enterprise software for desktops, laptops, tabs, gadgets, and servers, including Internet search (with Bing), the digital services market (through MSN), mixed reality (HoloLens), cloud computing (Azure), and software development (Visual Studio).\n\nSteve Ballmer replaced Gates as CEO in 2000, and later envisioned a \"devices and services\" strategy. This unfolded with Microsoft acquiring Danger Inc. in 2008, entering the personal computer production market for the first time in June 2012 with the launch of the Microsoft Surface line of tablet computers, and later forming Microsoft Mobile through the acquisition of Nokia's devices and services division. Since Satya Nadella took over as CEO in 2014, the company has scaled back on hardware and has instead focused on cloud computing, a move that helped the company's shares reach its highest value since December 1999.\n\nEarlier dethroned by Apple in 2010, in 2018 Microsoft reclaimed its position as the most valuable publicly traded company in the world. In April 2019, Microsoft reached the trillion-dollar market cap, becoming the third U.S. public company to be valued at over $1 trillion after Apple and Amazon respectively. As of 2020, Microsoft has the third-highest global brand valuation.", "question": {"id": "227358917da47be5", "question": "Who are the founders of the top tech company and what are their birth years?", "necessary_evidence": [{"pageid": 15373479, "revid": 1183243136, "title": "List of largest technology companies by revenue", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_technology_companies_by_revenue"}, {"pageid": 856, "revid": 1185504212, "title": "Apple Inc.", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc."}, {"pageid": 7412236, "revid": 1185884461, "title": "Steve Jobs", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs"}, {"pageid": 27848, "revid": 1184369143, "title": "Steve Wozniak", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Wozniak"}, {"pageid": 635752, "revid": 1181991592, "title": "Ronald Wayne", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Wayne"}], "categories": ["History", "Business", "Technology"]}}

{"id": "25ef59bd37b77340", "answer": "Martha Dandridge Custis Washington (June 2, 1731 \u2013 May 22, 1802) was the wife of George Washington, the first president of the United States. Although the title was not coined until after her death, Martha served as the inaugural first lady of the United States, defining the role of the president's wife and setting many precedents that future first ladies would observe. During her tenure, she was referred to as \"Lady Washington\". \n\nMartha was born on June 2, 1731, on her parents' tobacco plantation in Chestnut Grove in the Colony of Virginia. She was the oldest daughter of John Dandridge, a Virginia planter and county clerk who immigrated from England, and Frances Jones, the granddaughter of an Anglican rector. Martha had three brothers and four sisters.\n\nMartha Dandridge was married twice. Her first marriage was to Daniel Parke Custis with whom she had four children: Daniel, Frances, John, and Martha. After the death of her first husband, she married George Washington in 1759.\n\nAs the wife of both the head of government and the head of state, Martha was immediately faced with the pressure of representing the United States. She had to present the United States as a dignified nation to establish credibility among the countries of Europe, but she also had to respect the spirit of democracy by refusing to present herself as a queen. She was also aware that the precedent she set would be inherited by future presidential wives. Martha balanced these responsibilities by playing the role of a social hostess at presidential events, a role that would become the primary function of the first lady.

{"id": "4bc22abd7bd092f5", "answer": "Ojos del Salado is a stratovolcano located on the Argentina-Chile border. It is the highest volcano in the world, with an elevation of 6,893 meters (22,615 feet). The volcano is part of the Andes mountain range and is located in a region with extremely dry conditions, which prevent the formation of glaciers and a permanent snow cover. Despite the arid climate, there is a permanent crater lake about 100 meters in diameter at an elevation of 6,480-6,500 meters within the summit crater and east of the main summit. This is the highest lake of any kind in the world.\n\nThe volcano was volcanically active during the Pleistocene and Holocene, during which it mainly produced lava flows. The last eruption occurred around 750 CE. The mountain can be ascended from both the Argentine and the Chilean side, but owing to the better logistics most ascents occur from the Chilean side. The high elevation, cold and windy weather, and impassable terrain are common challenges for climbers.\n\nThe name \"Ojos del Salado\" refers to a river that the 1937 Polish expedition used to reach the mountain. There are two summits, known as the eastern or Argentine and western or Chilean summit; both lie along the international boundary and get their names after the country from which they can be more easily reached.", "question": {"id": "4bc22abd7bd092f5", "question": "Where are the five highest volcanoes located and when did they last erupt after the year 1500?

{"id": "983f3a0dd5f81663", "answer": "The \u00f7 Tour (pronounced the \"Divide Tour\") was the third world concert tour by English singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran, in support of his third studio album, \u00f7 (2017) (pronounced \"divide\"). The tour officially began on 16 March 2017, in Turin, Italy and ended on 26 August 2019, in Ipswich, England. The tour comprised 260 shows and set world records for the highest-grossing concert tour and the most tickets sold by a tour.\n\nAccording to Billboard, Sheeran's tour grossed $776.4 million and sold 8.88 million tickets across the 201 dates reported from 16 March 2017 to 31 October 2018. The tour was the eighth highest-grossing tour of 2017, accumulating $122 million and selling 1,408,681 tickets. The Divide Tour became 2018's highest-grossing tour with $429 million, setting all-time records for the highest-grossing solo tour and highest year-end gross ever. It then broke the all-time highest-grossing record of $735m for any tour set by the U2 360\u00b0 Tour before it finished, despite playing mostly in smaller venues and deliberately keeping the ticket price relatively low with no VIP areas. This is due to the larger number of shows (255) in the tour, and it also became the most attended tour of all time with over 8.5 million having attended in 43 countries with further dates to play.\n\nIn Ireland, more than 300,000 tickets for seven shows across Cork, Belfast, Galway, and Dublin were sold in a single day, making history with Sheeran being the only artist to ever do so in Irish territory. Due to the phenomenal demand, extra dates were added in both Cork and Dublin, with three dates for each city in total. Sellout status occurred once again in Santiago during his first concert on 15 May, prompting to add one more date.\n\nIn Oceania, the tour broke the official record for the most tickets sold, at over 1 million (previously held by the Dire Straits Brothers in Arms Tour of 1985, with around 950,000), as well as most stadium shows by a single artist on one tour (18, formerly held by AC/DC at 14). Sheeran also broke records for the biggest stadium tour of Australia and New Zealand, venue record for highest cumulative attendance on one tour and venue record for highest attendance for a single show. More than 710,000 tickets were sold within a single day of general public sale. In Sydney, a total of 243,513 tickets were sold for three shows at the ANZ Stadium, which rolled out over three successive nights from 15 to 17 March 2018. The attendance per show was 79,726, 81,752, and 82,035, respectively. This set a new record for aggregate attendance at a series of stadium concerts in NSW, smashing the old benchmark of 213,045 set by AC/DC during their Black Ice World Tour in 2010.", "question": {"id": "983f3a0dd5f81663", "question": "What was the first city visited on each of the four highest-grossing tours of all time?", "necessary_evidence": [{"pageid": 22277723, "revid": 1185477971, "title": "List of highest-grossing concert tours", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-grossing_concert_tours"}, {"pageid": 56397920, "revid": 1182161193, "title": "Farewell Yellow Brick Road", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farewell_Yellow_Brick_Road"}, {"pageid": 72156094, "revid": 1185932173, "title": "The Eras Tour", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Eras_Tour"}, {"pageid": 52992937, "revid": 1184667573, "title": "\u00f7 Tour", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%B7_Tour"}, {"pageid": 21844820, "revid": 1185927696, "title": "U2 360\u00b0 Tour", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U2_360%C2%B0_Tour"}], "categories": ["History", "Music"]}}
{"id": "b02fbdf68ddfc8f9", "answer": "John Henry Eaton (June 18, 1790 \u2013 November 17, 1856) was an American politician and ambassador from Tennessee. He served as a U.S. Senator and as U.S. Secretary of War in the administration of Andrew Jackson. He was 28 years, 4 months, and 29 days old when he entered the Senate, making him the youngest U.S. Senator in history.\n\nEaton was born near Scotland Neck, Halifax County, North Carolina to John and Elizabeth Eaton. He attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill from 1802 to 1804, studied law, attained admission to the bar, and moved to Franklin, Tennessee, where he established a law practice.\n\nFrom 1815 to 1816, Eaton was a member of the Tennessee House of Representatives. In 1818, he was elected to serve as a U.S. Senator from Tennessee, and he served until 1829. His age of 28 at the time of his entry to the Senate was notable; it contradicted the U.S. Constitution's requirement that all senators be at least 30 years old.\n\nEaton also served as the U.S. Secretary of War under Andrew Jackson from 1829\u20131831, the Territorial Governor of Florida from 1834\u20131836, and the U.S. Minister to Spain from 1836\u20131840.\n\nEaton and his wife lived comfortably in retirement in Washington, D.C. He resumed his law practice, and he and his wife returned to Franklin during the summers. Eaton died in Washington on November 17, 1856, at age 66. His funeral was conducted at his residence.

{"id": "d217418f8912063b", "answer": "Hesperia is a city in San Bernardino County, California, United States. It is located 35 miles (56 km) north of downtown San Bernardino in Victor Valley and surrounded by the Mojave Desert. Because of its relatively high elevation and the unique and moderate weather patterns of the region, Hesperia is part of what is locally called the High Desert. The name \"Hesperia\" means \"western land\". The 2019 census report estimates that the city has a population of 95,750.\n\nThe city was incorporated on July 1, 1988. The city council consists of Cameron Gregg (Mayor), Brigit Bennington (Pro tempore), Larry Bird, Rebekah Swanson, and William J. Holland. The city manager is Nils Bentsen.\n\nIn the early 1950s, land developer M. Penn Phillips and his silent financial partner, boxer Jack Dempsey, financed the building of roads and land subdivisions, promoting lots sales on television. They built the Hesperia Inn and golf course, which attracted a variety of Hollywood celebrities. The Hesperia Inn also housed the Jack Dempsey Museum.\n\nThe main wave of newcomers, though, arrived at Hesperia in the 1980s. Suburban growth transformed the small town of 5,000 people in 1970 to a moderate-sized city with a population over 60,000 by 2000, and an estimated population over 95,000 as of July 1, 2018.\n\nThe city of Hesperia contracts with the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department for law-enforcement services. The new 43,000 sq ft (4,000 m2) substation\u2014opened October 13, 2010\u2014is located at 15840 Smoketree in the city's Civic Plaza, across the street from City Hall. The old 7,600 sq ft (710 m2) substation, which served for many years, was on Santa Fe Avenue next to the BNSF tracks. The station provides full-service law enforcement for the city and the southern suburbs of Oak Hills and Marianas Ranchos. Additional deputies can respond as necessary from the nearby Victorville Regional Station.\n\nIn the California State Legislature, Hesperia is in the 21st Senate District, represented by Republican Scott Wilk, and in the 33rd Assembly District, represented by Republican Devon Mathis. In the United States House of Representatives, Hesperia is in California's 23rd congressional district, represented by Republican Jay Obernolte.", "question": {"id": "d217418f8912063b", "question": "What was the population in 1950 of the five least populous cities in the United States today?", "necessary_evidence": [{"pageid": 1649321, "revid": 1185657569, "title": "List of United States cities by population", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_cities_by_population"}, {"pageid": 52106, "revid": 1185304792, "title": "Albany, New York", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albany,_New_York"}, {"pageid": 107997, "revid": 1178659661, "title": "Hesperia, California", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hesperia,_California"}, {"pageid": 116717, "revid": 1184124687, "title": "New Bedford, Massachusetts", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Bedford,_Massachusetts"}, {"pageid": 8599, "revid": 1179868517, "title": "Davenport, Iowa", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davenport,_Iowa"}, {"pageid": 108106, "revid": 1181414083, "title": "Daly City, California", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daly_City,_California"}], "categories": ["History", "Demographics"]}}

{"id": "2d95bda2fb18742e", "answer": "Hugo Black was a Justice of the Supreme Court known for his literal enforcement of constitutional guarantees, especially the First Amendment free speech clause. He was often labeled an 'activist' due to his willingness to review legislation that arguably violated constitutional provisions. Black believed in the \"one man, one vote\" principle and was a strong defender of it. He also held a narrower interpretation of the Fourth Amendment than many of his colleagues, arguing that the Fourth Amendment only protected tangible items from physical searches or seizures.\n\nBlack took an absolutist approach to First Amendment jurisprudence, rejecting the creation of judicial tests for free speech standards. He believed that the First Amendment was \"wholly 'beyond the reach' of federal power to abridge\". He also held the view that the court should literally enforce constitutional guarantees.\n\nIn terms of criminal procedure, Black adopted a narrower interpretation of the Fourth Amendment than many of his colleagues on the Warren Court. He dissented from Katz v. United States (1967), in which the court held that warrantless wiretapping violated the Fourth Amendment's guarantee against unreasonable search and seizure. He argued that the Fourth Amendment only protected tangible items from physical searches or seizures. Thus, he concluded that telephone conversations were not within the scope of the amendment, and that warrantless wiretapping was consequently permissible.\n\nBlack was also one of the Supreme Court's foremost defenders of the \"one man, one vote\" principle. He delivered the opinion of the court in Wesberry v. Sanders (1964), holding that the Constitution required congressional districts in any state to be approximately equal in population.

{"id": "0b6a534f2246b3b8", "answer": "The Mexico City Metro (Spanish: Metro de la Ciudad de M\u00e9xico) is a rapid transit system that serves the metropolitan area of Mexico City, including some municipalities in the State of Mexico. It is operated by the Sistema de Transporte Colectivo (STC) and is the second largest metro system in North America after the New York City Subway.\n\nThe metro has 195 stations, 44 of which serve two or more lines. Many stations are named for historical figures, places, or events in Mexican history. It has 115 underground stations, 54 surface stations, and 26 elevated stations. All lines operate from 5 a.m. to midnight. The most recent STC Metro line, Line 12, was built to run approximately 26 kilometers (16 miles) towards the southeastern part of the city, connecting with Lines 7, 3, 2, and 8. This line opened on 30 October 2012.\n\nThe maximum design speed limit is 80 km/h (50 mph) for rubber-tired rolling stock and 100 km/h (62 mph) for steel-wheeled rolling stock. The metro offers in and out-street transfers to four major rapid transit systems: the Mexico City Metrob\u00fas and State of Mexico Mexib\u00fas bus rapid transit systems, the Mexico City light rail system, and the Ferrocarril Suburbano (FSZMVM) commuter rail.\n\nIn an attempt to modernize public transport, in October 2012, the Mexico City government implemented the use of a prepaid fare card, or stored-value card, called Tarjeta DF (Tarjeta del Distrito Federal, literally Federal District Card) as a payment method for STC Metro, Metrob\u00fas and the city's trolleybus and light rail systems.\n\nFor more detailed information, you can visit the [Mexico City Metro Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico_City_Metro).", "question": {"id": "0b6a534f2246b3b8", "question": "How many metro/subway lines are there in each of the capitals of the top 5 most populous Latin American countries?", "necessary_evidence": [{"pageid": 18524, "revid": 1185512992, "title": "Latin America", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_America"}, {"pageid": 3060673, "revid": 1176317924, "title": "Federal District Metro (Brazil)", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_District_Metro_(Brazil)"}, {"pageid": 891641, "revid": 1185468287, "title": "Mexico City Metro", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico_City_Metro"}, {"pageid": 18531315, "revid": 1181604900, "title": "Bogot\u00e1 Metro", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogot%C3%A1_Metro"}, {"pageid": 984962, "revid": 1182767515, "title": "Buenos Aires Underground", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buenos_Aires_Underground"}, {"pageid": 1539310, "revid": 1177646010, "title": "Lima and Callao Metro", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lima_and_Callao_Metro"}], "categories": ["Urban Studies", "Geography"]}}

{"id": "5ae9997797983bca", "answer": "The Super Bowl is the annual American football game that determines the champion of the National Football League (NFL). The game culminates a season that begins in the previous calendar year, and is the conclusion of the NFL playoffs. The winner receives the Vince Lombardi Trophy. The contest is held in an American city, chosen three to four years beforehand, usually at warm-weather sites or domed stadiums.\n\nA total of 20 franchises, including teams that have relocated to another city or changed their name, have won the Super Bowl. There are four NFL teams that have never appeared in a Super Bowl: the Cleveland Browns, Detroit Lions, Jacksonville Jaguars, and Houston Texans, though both the Browns and Lions had won NFL Championship Games prior to the creation of the Super Bowl in the 1966 season.\n\nSome teams have had notable streaks or records in the Super Bowl. For example, the Green Bay Packers won the first two Super Bowls, and also won the NFL Championship Game the preceding year. The Miami Dolphins appeared in three consecutive Super Bowls, winning the last two, and coming within one win of three consecutive Super Bowl titles. The New England Patriots won Super Bowls XLIX, LI, and LIII for three wins in five seasons.

{"id": "fafc8e4104eb727f", "answer": "The United Kingdom is the 7th largest island country in the world, with a total area of 248,532 square kilometers. It is made up of over one thousand small islands, with the largest being Great Britain. The UK is divided into four countries: England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. England is the largest, accounting for just over half the total area of the UK, followed by Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.\n\nThe physical geography of the UK varies greatly. England consists mostly of lowland terrain, with upland or mountainous terrain found north-west of the Tees\u2013Exe line. Scotland is the most mountainous country in the UK, with its physical geography distinguished by the Highland Boundary Fault which separates the Highlands to the north and west, and the Lowlands to the south and east.\n\nThe UK's climate is temperate, with some areas of Scotland being Tundra and Subarctic. The country is reducing greenhouse gas emissions and has met the Kyoto Protocol target of a 12.5% reduction from 1990 levels.\n\nThe UK's economic geography reflects its position in the global economy and its history as a trading nation and imperial power. The country led the industrial revolution, and its urban character is a legacy of this. The UK's primary industry was once dominated by the coal industry, but now the major primary industry is North Sea oil.\n\nThe UK has a devolved system of government, with Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland having their own devolved administrations and legislatures.

{"id": "d30732e4b4ecc96f", "answer": "Vatican City, also known as the Vatican City State, is a city-state enclaved within Rome, Italy. It is the smallest internationally recognized independent state in the world, both by area and population. The Pope is the head of state of Vatican City, a function dependent on his primordial function as bishop of the diocese of Rome and head of the Catholic Church. The term \"Holy See\" refers not to the Vatican state but to the Pope's spiritual and pastoral governance, largely exercised through the Roman Curia.\n\nThe Vatican City State budget includes the Vatican Museums and post office and is supported financially by the sale of stamps, coins, medals and tourist mementos; by fees for admission to museums; and by publications sales. The incomes and living standards of lay workers are comparable to those of counterparts who work in the city of Rome.\n\nVatican City has no formally enacted official language, but, unlike the Holy See which most often uses Latin for the authoritative version of its official documents, Vatican City uses only Italian in its legislation and official communications. Italian is also the everyday language used by most of those who work in the state.\n\nVatican City is home to some of the most famous art in the world. St. Peter's Basilica, whose successive architects include Bramante, Michelangelo, Giacomo della Porta, Maderno and Bernini, is a renowned work of Renaissance architecture. The Sistine Chapel is famous for its frescos, which include works by Perugino, Domenico Ghirlandaio and Botticelli as well as the ceiling and Last Judgment by Michelangelo.

{"id": "079294033cf57398", "answer": "Samuel Moore Walton (March 29, 1918 \u2013 April 5, 1992) was an American business magnate best known for founding the retailers Walmart and Sam's Club. Walton started Walmart in 1962 and Sam's Club in 1983. His company, Wal-Mart Stores Inc., grew to be the world's largest corporation by revenue and the biggest private employer in the world. For a period of time, Walton was the richest person in the United States. His family has remained the richest family in the U.S. for several consecutive years, with a net worth of around US$240.6 billion as of January 2022.\n\nWalton was born to Thomas Gibson Walton and Nancy Lee, in Kingfisher, Oklahoma. He lived there with his parents on their farm until 1923. After high school, Walton decided to attend college, hoping to find a better way to help support his family. He attended the University of Missouri as an ROTC cadet. Upon graduating in 1940 with a bachelor's degree in economics, he was voted \"permanent president\" of the class.\n\nWalton joined J. C. Penney as a management trainee in Des Moines, Iowa, three days after graduating from college. This position paid him $75 a month. Walton spent approximately 18 months with J. C. Penney. He resigned in 1942 in anticipation of being inducted into the military for service in World War II. In the meantime, he worked at a DuPont munitions plant near Tulsa, Oklahoma. Soon afterwards, Walton joined the military in the U.S. Army Intelligence Corps, supervising security at aircraft plants. In this position he served at Fort Douglas in Salt Lake City, Utah. He eventually reached the rank of captain.\n\nWalton married Helen Robson on Valentine's Day, February 14, 1943. They had four children: Samuel Robson (Rob) born in 1944, John Thomas (1946\u20132005), James Carr (Jim) born in 1948, and Alice Louise born in 1949. Walton supported various charitable causes. He and Helen were active in 1st Presbyterian Church in Bentonville; Sam served as an Elder and a Sunday School teacher, teaching high school age students.

Ganymede is larger than the planet Mercury, but has somewhat less surface gravity than Mercury, Io, or the Moon.\n\nGanymede was discovered by Simon Marius and Galileo Galilei in 1610, making it one of the first group of objects discovered orbiting another planet. Its name was suggested by astronomer Simon Marius, after the mythological Ganymede, a Trojan prince desired by Zeus (the Greek counterpart of Jupiter), who carried him off to be the cupbearer of the gods.\n\nSeveral spacecraft have explored Ganymede, beginning with Pioneer 10. The Voyager probes, Voyager 1 and Voyager 2, refined measurements of its size, while Galileo discovered its underground ocean and magnetic field. The next planned mission to the Jovian system is the European Space Agency's Jupiter Icy Moon Explorer (JUICE), which was launched in 2023.

In addition, the president names and dismisses ambassadors to foreign countries, and signs and annuls treaties with foreign entities.

It's considered the longest river in the world, though this is disputed by some who claim the Amazon River in South America is longer. The Nile is about 6,650 km (4,130 mi) long and its drainage basin covers eleven countries: Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, Ethiopia, Eritrea, South Sudan, Republic of the Sudan, and Egypt. \n\nThe Nile has two major tributaries \u2013 the White Nile and the Blue Nile. The White Nile is considered to be the headwaters and primary stream of the Nile itself. The Blue Nile, however, is the source of most of the water and silt. The White Nile is longer and rises in the Great Lakes region of central Africa, with the most distant source in southern Rwanda. It flows north through Tanzania, Lake Victoria, Uganda and South Sudan. The Blue Nile starts at Lake Tana in Ethiopia and flows into Sudan from the southeast. The two rivers meet near Sudan's capital, Khartoum.\n\nThe northern section of the river flows almost entirely through desert, from Sudan into Egypt. Most of the population and cities of Egypt lie along those parts of the Nile valley north of Aswan, and nearly all the cultural and historical sites of Ancient Egypt are found along the riverbanks.

{"id": "37a223dab8f95200", "answer": "Dan Brown is an American author known for his thriller novels, including \"The Da Vinci Code\" and \"Angels & Demons\". He was born on June 22, 1964. Brown's writing often combines elements of mystery, adventure, and conspiracy theories. His books have been translated into 57 languages and, as of 2012, have sold over 200 million copies.\n\nBrown's interest in secrets and puzzles stems from their presence in his childhood. His father, a mathematics teacher, and mother, a professional musician, often used complex treasure hunts to celebrate special occasions. Brown later applied these themes to his novels.\n\nIn 1994, Brown released a CD titled \"Angels & Demons\", which shares its title with his later novel. The CD's artwork features an ambigram by the artist John Langdon, which was also used for the novel.\n\nBrown's prose style has been criticized as clumsy, with \"The Da Vinci Code\" described as 'committing style and word choice blunders in almost every paragraph'. Despite the criticism, his novels have achieved significant commercial success.\n\nIn 2006, Brown's publisher, Random House, won a copyright infringement case brought by authors Michael Baigent and Richard Leigh.

By the mid-18th century, Edo had become one of the world's most populous cities with over one million inhabitants. Following the Meiji Restoration in 1868, the imperial capital was moved from Kyoto to Edo, and the city was renamed Tokyo, which means 'Eastern Capital'. \n\nTokyo is located on the eastern coast of Honshu, the largest of Japan's four main islands. The city is part of the Kanto region, which also includes seven other prefectures: Gunma, Tochigi, Ibaraki, Saitama, Chiba, Kanagawa, and Yamanashi. Tokyo is bordered by the Tokyo Bay to the south, Chiba Prefecture to the east, Saitama Prefecture to the north, and Kanagawa Prefecture to the south and west.\n\nThe city has numerous outlying islands, which extend as far as 1,850 km (1,150 mi) from central Tokyo. These islands are administered by local subprefectural branch offices due to their distance from the administrative headquarters of the Tokyo Metropolitan Government in Shinjuku. The Izu and Ogasawara Islands are part of these outlying islands.\n\nTokyo is the largest population center in Japan and the site of the country's largest broadcasters and studios. It is frequently the setting for many Japanese movies, television shows, animated series (anime), web comics, light novels, video games, and comic books (manga). \n\nThe city is also a major international finance center and houses the headquarters of several of the world's largest investment banks and insurance companies. It serves as a hub for Japan's transportation, publishing, electronics, and broadcasting industries. Tokyo has the largest metropolitan economy in the world.

{"id": "39d33c22568491be", "answer": "American Airlines is a major American airline headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas. It is the world's largest airline when measured by fleet size, scheduled passengers carried, and revenue passenger mile. American, together with its regional partners, operates an extensive international and domestic network with almost 6,800 flights per day to nearly 350 destinations in more than 50 countries.\n\nAmerican Airlines is a founding member of the Oneworld alliance, the third-largest airline alliance in the world. Regional service is operated by independent and subsidiary carriers under the brand name American Eagle.\n\nIn 2011, due to a downturn in the airline industry, American Airlines' parent company, the AMR Corporation, filed for bankruptcy protection. In 2013, American Airlines merged with US Airways but kept the American Airlines name, as it was the better-recognized brand internationally; the combination of the two airlines resulted in the creation of the largest airline in the United States, and ultimately the world.\n\nAs of July 2022, American Airlines flies to 269 domestic destinations and 81 international destinations in 58 countries in five continents. American currently operates ten hubs.\n\nAmerican had a direct role in the development of the Douglas DC-3, which resulted from a marathon telephone call from American Airlines CEO C. R. Smith to Douglas Aircraft Company founder Donald Wills Douglas Sr., when Smith persuaded a reluctant Douglas to design a sleeper aircraft based on the DC-2 to replace American's Curtiss Condor II biplanes. The prototype DST (Douglas Sleeper Transport) first flew on December 17, 1935, the 32nd anniversary of the Wright Brothers' flight at Kitty Hawk. Its cabin was 92\u00a0in (2.3\u00a0m) wide, and a version with 21 seats instead of the 14\u201316 sleeping berths of the DST was given the designation DC-3. \n\nAmerican also had a direct role in the development of the DC-10, which resulted from a specification from American Airlines to manufacturers in 1966 to offer a widebody aircraft that was smaller than the Boeing 747, but capable of flying similar long-range routes from airports with shorter runways. McDonnell Douglas responded with the DC-10 trijet shortly after the two companies' merger. On February 19, 1968, the president of American Airlines, George A. Spater, and James S. McDonnell of McDonnell Douglas announced American's intention to acquire the DC-10. American Airlines ordered 25 DC-10s in its first order. The DC-10 made its first flight on August 29, 1970, and received its type certificate from the FAA on July 29, 1971. On August 5, 1971, the DC-10 entered commercial service with American Airlines on a round trip flight between Los Angeles and Chicago.\n\nAmerican Airlines has been involved in several controversies and incidents, including safety occurrences and complaints about discriminatory practices. The airline has also made commitments towards achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.", "question": {"id": "39d33c22568491be", "question": "What are the founding dates of the top 5 largest North American airlines (sorted by passengers carried) that start with the letter \"A\"?", "necessary_evidence": [{"pageid": 11898233, "revid": 1183808853, "title": "List of largest airlines in North America", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_airlines_in_North_America"}, {"pageid": 2386, "revid": 1184939193, "title": "American Airlines", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Airlines"}, {"pageid": 264796, "revid": 1185461143, "title": "Alaska Airlines", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska_Airlines"}, {"pageid": 145623, "revid": 1185827533, "title": "Air Canada", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Canada"}, {"pageid": 84578, "revid": 1184447099, "title": "Aerom\u00e9xico", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerom%C3%A9xico"}, {"pageid": 1372018, "revid": 1185939442, "title": "Allegiant Air", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegiant_Air"}], "categories": ["History", "Aviation"]}}

{"id": "bb238a343ec362af", "answer": "Reveille is the official mascot of Texas A&M University. The first Reveille, a mixed-breed dog, was adopted by students in 1931. The cadets raised $100 during World War II to make Reveille a general, as part of a fundraiser for the K-9 Corps. Reveille is the highest-ranking member of the Texas A&M Corps of Cadets. All Reveilles to date have been female. The current mascot, Reveille X, assumed her role as mascot on April 30, 2021. \n\nReveille is considered a cadet general and the highest-ranking member in the Corps of Cadets. To designate her rank, Reveille wears five diamonds on her maroon-and-white blanket. Freshmen cadets are required to address her as \"Miss Rev, ma'am.\" Reveille is the only canine on campus, other than service animals, that is permitted to enter any campus building. It is a widely held tradition that if Reveille decides to sleep on a cadet's bed, that cadet is required to sleep on the floor. However, in reality, she is constantly under the care of her handler and is not permitted to freely roam the dormitory or campus. This tradition likely applied only to the first Reveille. By tradition, if she barks in class, that session is cancelled. Reveille has her own cell phone, operated by the mascot corporal, and her own student identification card.\n\nTexas A&M maintains a cemetery on campus where all of the past Reveilles are buried. Reveilles I through IV were buried side by side in a small cemetery in front of Kyle Field with their noses and paws pointed so that they could look through the north tunnel and see the stadium scoreboard. This way, \"they can always watch the Aggies outscore their opponent on the field.\"", "question": {"id": "bb238a343ec362af", "question": "What are the mascots of the top 5 public universities in the US by enrollment?", "necessary_evidence": [{"pageid": 1852005, "revid": 1183888922, "title": "List of United States public university campuses by enrollment", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_public_university_campuses_by_enrollment"}, {"pageid": 29927, "revid": 1185620767, "title": "Texas A&M University", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_A%26M_University"}, {"pageid": 154521, "revid": 1185843313, "title": "University of Central Florida", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Central_Florida"}, {"pageid": 80135, "revid": 1185734258, "title": "Rutgers University", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rutgers_University"}, {"pageid": 60611, "revid": 1182756463, "title": "University of Florida", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Florida"}, {"pageid": 22217, "revid": 1185810827, "title": "Ohio State University", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_State_University"}], "categories": ["Education"]}}

A member of six NBA championship teams as a player and two more as an assistant coach, Abdul-Jabbar twice was voted NBA Finals MVP. In 1996, he was honored as one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History. NBA coach Pat Riley and players Isiah Thomas and Julius Erving have called him the greatest basketball player of all time.\n\nAfter winning 71 consecutive basketball games on his high school team in New York City, Lew Alcindor attended college at UCLA, where he played for coach John Wooden on three consecutive national championship basketball teams and was a record three-time MVP of the NCAA Tournament.\n\nDrafted by the one-season-old Bucks franchise in the 1969 NBA draft with the first overall pick, Alcindor spent six seasons in Milwaukee. After winning his first NBA championship in 1971, he adopted the Muslim name Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. He won his second NBA championship in 1975 and was traded to the Lakers in 1975. Abdul-Jabbar won four more NBA championships with the Lakers during the 1980s. His contributions were a key component in the \"Showtime\" era of Lakers basketball. Over his 20-year NBA career, his teams succeeded in making the playoffs 18 times and got past the first round 14 times; his teams reached the NBA Finals on 10 occasions.\n\nAt the time of his retirement at age 42 in 1989, Abdul-Jabbar was the NBA's all-time leader in points scored (38,387), games played (1,560), minutes played (57,446), field goals made (15,837), field goal attempts (28,307), blocked shots (3,189), defensive rebounds (9,394), and personal fouls (4,657). He remains the all-time leading scorer in the NBA, and is ranked third all-time in both rebounds and blocks. In 2007, ESPN voted him the greatest center of all time, in 2008, they named him the \"greatest player in college basketball history\", and in 2016, they named him the second best player in NBA history (behind Michael Jordan).

{"id": "0f4f60cabaa66b57", "answer": "The official currency of the People's Republic of China is the Renminbi (RMB), with the primary unit being the Yuan. The currency symbol for the Yuan is \u00a5. The ISO code for the Renminbi is CNY, which stands for China's country code (CN) plus \"Y\" from \"yuan\". The currency is sometimes referred to as the \"redback\", a play on \"greenback\", a slang term for the US dollar. The Renminbi is the world's 5th most traded currency as of April 2022. \n\nIn everyday Mandarin, \"kuai\" is usually used when discussing money and \"renminbi\" or \"yuan\" are rarely heard. Similarly, Mandarin speakers typically use \"mao\" instead of \"jiao\".

{"id": "84e26144950859d8", "answer": "The Academy Award for Best Actor is an award presented annually by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS). It has been awarded since the 1st Academy Awards to an actor who has delivered an outstanding performance in a leading role in a film released that year. The award is traditionally presented by the previous year's Best Actress winner.\n\nThe Best Actor award has been presented 95 times, to 85 different actors. The first winner was Emil Jannings for his roles in *The Last Command* (1928) and *The Way of All Flesh* (1927). The most recent winner is Brendan Fraser for *The Whale*; he is the first Canadian actor to win this award. The record for most wins is three, held by Daniel Day-Lewis, while nine other actors have won twice. The record for most nominations is nine, jointly held by Spencer Tracy and Laurence Olivier.\n\nIn the first three years of the awards, actors and actresses were nominated as the best individuals in their categories. At that time, all of their work during the qualifying period (as many as three films, in some cases) was listed after the award. The current system, in which an actor is nominated for a specific performance in a single film, was introduced for the 4th Academy Awards.

{"id": "aadae23ab1005392", "answer": "Walmart is the largest retailer in the world, known for its \"tradition of tailoring its service to churchgoing customers\". It has a significant presence in the Bible Belt and sells a large amount of Christian-themed merchandise. Walmart has also made efforts to expand its U.S. customer base by modifying its merchandising strategy to reflect six demographic groups: African-Americans, the affluent, empty-nesters, Hispanics, suburbanites, and rural residents.\n\nIn 2006, Walmart began a shift from a \"one-size-fits-all\" merchandising strategy to one designed to cater to these different demographic groups. This change was accompanied by a new slogan: \"Saving people money so they can live better lives\".\n\nWalmart's UK subsidiary, Asda, is based in Leeds and accounted for 42.7 percent of Walmart's international division's sales in 2006. Unlike Walmart's U.S. operations, Asda is primarily a grocery chain, but it has a stronger focus on non-food items than most UK supermarket chains other than Tesco.\n\nAbout 40 percent of products sold in Walmart are private labels, which are produced for the company through contracts with manufacturers. Walmart began offering private label brands in 1991, with the launch of Sam's Choice, a line of drinks produced by Cott Beverages for Walmart. Other Walmart brands include Great Value and Equate in the U.S. and Canada and Smart Price in Britain.\n\nIn recent years, Walmart has made several acquisitions to expand its business.

It is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world and is considered a holy city in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. The city is often associated with Abraham, who is described in the biblical book of Genesis as purchasing the Cave of the Patriarchs from Ephron the Hittite. This site, along with the rest of the city, has been a focal point of religious conflict between Jews and Muslims since the Israeli occupation of the West Bank in 1967.\n\nIn terms of population, historical records indicate that in 1820, there were about 1,000 Jews in Hebron. In 1838, Hebron had an estimated 1,500 taxable Muslim households, in addition to 41 Jewish tax-payers. The total population was estimated at 10,000. In 1842, it was estimated that about 400 Arab and 120 Jewish families lived in Hebron.\n\nUnfortunately, I couldn't find the exact current or projected population for 2023.

At 165,250,000 square kilometers (63,800,000 square miles) in area, this largest division of the World Ocean and the hydrosphere covers about 46% of Earth's water surface and about 32% of the planet's total surface area, larger than its entire land area.

{"id": "0cf4d94877b75c95", "answer": "Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that was conceived in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum. It was designed as a successor to the ABC programming language, with the ability to handle exceptions and interface with the Amoeba operating system. Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability and ease of use, with its notable use of significant whitespace.\n\nPython has a dynamic and strong typing discipline, with many built-in types. These include numerical types such as `bool`, `int`, `float`, `complex`, and sequence types like `list`, `tuple`, `range`, `str`, `bytes`. It also includes types for sets and mappings like `set`, `frozenset`, `dict`, and several others.\n\nPython supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. Python's object system is class-based, and methods in Python have an explicit `self` parameter to access instance data.\n\nPython's standard library is very extensive, offering a wide range of facilities as indicated by the long table of contents listed in its documentation. The library contains built-in modules (written in C) that provide access to system functionality such as file I/O that would otherwise be inaccessible to Python programmers, as well as modules written in Python that provide standardized solutions for many problems that occur in everyday programming.\n\nPython's development is conducted largely through the Python Enhancement Proposal (PEP) process. Python's performance compared to other programming languages is also benchmarked by The Computer Language Benchmarks Game.\n\nPython is often used as a scripting language, but is also used in a wide range of non-scripting contexts. It has been successfully embedded in many software products as a scripting language, including in finite element method software such as Abaqus, 3D parametric modeler like FreeCAD, and 3D animation packages such as 3ds Max, Blender, Cinema 4D, Lightwave, Houdini, Maya, modo, MotionBuilder, Softimage, the visual effects compositor Nuke, 2D imaging programs like GIMP,[132] Inkscape, Scribus and Paint Shop Pro,[133] and musical notation programs like scorewriter and capella.

Despite these challenges, Wilson continued to play for the Broncos, although his performance was reportedly underwhelming in a game against the Raiders in November 2022.\n\nOff the field, Wilson has made appearances on several television shows, including the Late Show with David Letterman, Jimmy Kimmel Live!, and Late Night with Seth Meyers.

{"id": "5d52bc2cbbff2826", "answer": "Vatican City, officially known as Vatican City State, is a landlocked independent city-state and enclave within Rome, Italy. It became independent from Italy in 1929 with the Lateran Treaty. The city-state is a distinct territory under the \"full ownership, exclusive dominion, and sovereign authority and jurisdiction\" of the Holy See, which is a sovereign entity under international law. The Holy See maintains the city-state's temporal power and governance, diplomatic, and spiritual independence.\n\nThe Pope is the ex officio head of state of Vatican City, a function dependent on his primordial function as bishop of the diocese of Rome and head of the Catholic Church. The term \"Holy See\" refers not to the Vatican state but to the Pope's spiritual and pastoral governance, largely exercised through the Roman Curia. His official title with regard to Vatican City is Sovereign of the State of the Vatican City.\n\nThe Vatican City State budget includes the Vatican Museums and post office and is supported financially by the sale of stamps, coins, medals and tourist mementos; by fees for admission to museums; and by publications sales. The incomes and living standards of lay workers are comparable to those of counterparts who work in the city of Rome. Other industries include printing, the production of mosaics, and the manufacture of staff uniforms. There is a Vatican Pharmacy.\n\nThe Vatican City State is not a member of the European Court of Human Rights. Among European states, Belarus is also not a member, while Russia has ceased to be part of it after being expelled from the Council of Europe following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.

{"id": "7aa2ea41fafb590d", "answer": "The atmosphere of Venus is primarily composed of carbon dioxide, with clouds consisting of sulfuric acid. The planet's atmosphere is much denser and hotter than Earth's. In 2020, there was significant discussion about the potential presence of phosphine (PH3) in trace amounts in Venus' atmosphere. Phosphine is considered a potential biomarker indicating the presence of life. However, no known abiotic source on Venus could produce phosphine in the quantities detected. This led to speculation about the possibility of life on Venus, although the data is still under review and the presence of phosphine is not definitively confirmed.\n\nIn June 2021, NASA selected the DAVINCI+ mission to send an atmospheric probe to Venus in the late 2020s. The mission aims to measure the composition of Venus' atmosphere to understand how it formed and evolved, and to determine whether the planet ever had an ocean. The mission will involve a descent sphere that will plunge through the planet's thick atmosphere, making measurements of noble gases and other elements to understand Venus' climate change. This will be the first U.S.-led mission to Venus' atmosphere since 1978.\n\nThe atmosphere of Venus also exhibits some interesting phenomena. For instance, a sea of supercritical carbon dioxide transfers heat very efficiently, buffering the temperature changes between night and day. There is also a phenomenon known as virga, where sulfuric acid rain never reaches the ground but is evaporated by the heat before reaching the surface. In 2009, a prominent bright spot in the atmosphere was noted by an amateur astronomer and photographed by Venus Express, but its cause is currently unknown.", "question": {"id": "7aa2ea41fafb590d", "question": "What compound is most abundant in the atmospheres of each planet in the solar system?", "necessary_evidence": [{"pageid": 26903, "revid": 1183708292, "title": "Solar System", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System"}, {"pageid": 19694, "revid": 1183949157, "title": "Mercury (planet)", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(planet)"}, {"pageid": 32745, "revid": 1185890721, "title": "Venus", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus"}, {"pageid": 9228, "revid": 1184861997, "title": "Earth", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth"}, {"pageid": 14640471, "revid": 1184868366, "title": "Mars", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars"}, {"pageid": 38930, "revid": 1185658145, "title": "Jupiter", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter"}, {"pageid": 44474, "revid": 1184248068, "title": "Saturn", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn"}, {"pageid": 44475, "revid": 1185763248, "title": "Uranus", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranus"}, {"pageid": 19003265, "revid": 1185057244, "title": "Neptune", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neptune"}], "categories": ["Chemistry", "Astronomy"]}}

{"id": "e0356ef29623f03b", "answer": "Hydrogen is a chemical element with the symbol H and atomic number 1. It is the lightest and most abundant chemical substance in the universe, constituting roughly 75% of its elemental mass. Hydrogen is the raw material that most stars \"burn\" to produce energy. The same process, known as nuclear fusion, is being studied as a possible power source for use on earth.\n\nHydrogen was first artificially produced in the early 16th century by the reaction of acids on metals. In 1766\u201381, Henry Cavendish was the first to recognize that hydrogen gas was a discrete substance, and that it produces water when burned, a property which later gave it its name, which in Greek means \"water-former\".\n\nHydrogen gas (dihydrogen or molecular hydrogen) is highly flammable and will burn in air at a very wide range of concentrations between 4% and 75% by volume. The enthalpy of combustion is \u2212286 kJ/mol.\n\nHydrogen gas forms explosive mixtures with air in concentrations from 4\u201374% and with chlorine at 5\u201395%. The hydrogen autoignition temperature, the temperature of spontaneous ignition in air, is 500 \u00b0C (932 \u00b0F).\n\nHydrogen poses a number of hazards to human safety, from potential detonations and fires when mixed with air to being an asphyxiant in its pure, oxygen-free form. In addition, liquid hydrogen is a cryogen and presents dangers (such as frostbite) associated with very cold liquids. Hydrogen dissolves in many metals and in addition to leaking out, may have adverse effects on them, such as hydrogen embrittlement, leading to cracks and explosions. Hydrogen gas leaking into external air may spontaneously ignite. Moreover, hydrogen fire, while being extremely hot, is almost invisible, and thus can lead to accidental burns.\n\nHydrogen was liquefied for the first time by James Dewar in 1898 by using regenerative cooling and his invention, the vacuum flask. He produced solid hydrogen the next year. Deuterium was discovered in December 1931 by Harold Urey, and tritium was prepared in 1934 by Ernest Rutherford, Mark Oliphant, and Paul Harteck. Heavy water, which consists of deuterium in the place of regular hydrogen, was discovered by Urey's group in 1932. Fran\u00e7ois Isaac de Rivaz built the first de Rivaz engine, an internal combustion engine powered by a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen in 1806. Edward Daniel Clarke invented the hydrogen gas blowpipe in 1819. The D\u00f6bereiner's lamp and limelight were invented in 1823.\n\nFor more detailed information, please refer to the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen).", "question": {"id": "e0356ef29623f03b", "question": "Who discovered Oxygen, Hydrogen, Nitrogen, Helium, and Neon, and in what years were they discovered?", "necessary_evidence": [{"pageid": 22303, "revid": 1185600775, "title": "Oxygen", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen#Discovery"}, {"pageid": 13255, "revid": 1185762725, "title": "Hydrogen", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen#Discovery_and_use"}, {"pageid": 21175, "revid": 1185600722, "title": "Nitrogen", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#Discovery"}, {"pageid": 13256, "revid": 1185600362, "title": "Helium", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium#Scientific_discoveries"}, {"pageid": 21273, "revid": 1185831148, "title": "Neon", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neon#History"}], "categories": ["Chemistry", "History"]}}

{"id": "b0aa2655b15c4713", "answer": "Lung cancer, also known as lung carcinoma, is a type of cancer that begins in the lungs. It is the deadliest type of cancer, but it receives the third-most funding from the US National Cancer Institute. The risk of lung cancer is influenced by environmental exposure, particularly cigarette smoking, which accounts for 85\u201390% of lung cancer cases. Other risk factors include occupational risks in mining, shipbuilding, petroleum refining, and occupations that involve asbestos exposure.\n\nScreening programs may result in early detection of lung tumors in people who are not yet experiencing symptoms of lung cancer. The treatment for early-stage lung cancer includes surgery to remove the tumor, sometimes followed by radiation therapy and chemotherapy to kill any remaining cancer cells. Later stage cancer is treated with radiation therapy and chemotherapy alongside drug treatments that target specific cancer subtypes.\n\nDespite treatment, only around 20% of people survive five years on from their diagnosis. Survival rates are higher in those diagnosed at an earlier stage, diagnosed at a younger age, and in women compared to men. Consequently, lung cancer prevention efforts encourage people to avoid hazardous chemicals and quit smoking. Quitting smoking both reduces one's chance of developing lung cancer and improves treatment outcomes in those already diagnosed with lung cancer.", "question": {"id": "b0aa2655b15c4713", "question": "What are the 5-year survival rates (in percentage) of the top 5 most common cancers in the world amongst females?", "necessary_evidence": [{"pageid": 21499583, "revid": 1175444387, "title": "Epidemiology of cancer", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology_of_cancer"}, {"pageid": 70547, "revid": 1185527758, "title": "Breast cancer", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"}, {"pageid": 18450, "revid": 1182616742, "title": "Lung cancer", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer"}, {"pageid": 206979, "revid": 1185068172, "title": "Colorectal cancer", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"}, {"pageid": 412809, "revid": 1185928965, "title": "Endometrial cancer", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endometrial_cancer"}, {"pageid": 71418, "revid": 1182342823, "title": "Non-Hodgkin lymphoma", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Hodgkin_lymphoma"}], "categories": ["Women's Health", "Epidemiology", "Oncology"]}}

The event took place from 15 September to 1 October 2000. Teams from 199 countries participated in the Games, which were the first to feature at least 300 events in its official sports program. The Games' cost was estimated to be A$6.6 billion.\n\nSydney was selected as the host city for the 2000 Games in 1993, after being selected over Beijing, Berlin, Istanbul, and Manchester in four rounds of voting, at the 101st IOC Session in Monte Carlo, Monaco. The Australian city of Melbourne, which also hosted the 1956 Summer Olympics, had lost out to Atlanta for the 1996 Summer Olympics three years earlier.\n\nThe opening ceremony began with a tribute to the Australian pastoral heritage of the Australian stockmen and the importance of the stock horse in Australia's heritage. The Australian National Anthem was sung in the first verse by Human Nature and the second by Julie Anthony.\n\nOne of the most memorable moments of the games was when Australian Cathy Freeman won the 400-metre final in front of a jubilant Sydney crowd at the Olympic Stadium. Freeman's win made her the first competitor in Olympic Games history to light the Olympic Flame and then go on to win a Gold Medal.\n\nFour cities have been chosen by the IOC to host upcoming Olympic Games: Paris for the 2024 Summer Olympics, Milan\u2013Cortina d'Ampezzo for the 2026 Winter Olympics, Los Angeles for the 2028 Summer Olympics, and Brisbane for the 2032 Summer Olympics.", "question": {"id": "fc145094bd723364", "question": "What are the host cities of the Summer Olympic Games for the years 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012, and 2016, and what's the official motto for each of these Olympic Games?", "necessary_evidence": [{"pageid": 27566, "revid": 1185946854, "title": "Summer Olympic Games", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games"}, {"pageid": 71432, "revid": 1184243340, "title": "2000 Summer Olympics", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_Summer_Olympics"}, {"pageid": 77741, "revid": 1183858763, "title": "2004 Summer Olympics", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_Summer_Olympics"}, {"pageid": 77745, "revid": 1179552423, "title": "2008 Summer Olympics", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Summer_Olympics"}, {"pageid": 2176142, "revid": 1184780498, "title": "2012 Summer Olympics", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Summer_Olympics"}, {"pageid": 961522, "revid": 1185196636, "title": "2016 Summer Olympics", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Summer_Olympics"}], "categories": ["Sports"]}}

It is the largest country in the world by land area, covering more than one-eighth of the Earth's inhabited land area. The country extends across eleven time zones and a wide range of environments and landscapes.\n\nThe name \"Russia\" is derived from Rus', a medieval state populated primarily by the East Slavs. The word Rus' itself comes from the Rus' people, a group of Swedish Vikings who ventured along the waterways extending from the eastern Baltic to the Black and Caspian Seas. In Russian, the current name of the country, \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f (Rossiya), comes from the Byzantine Greek name for Rus', \u03a1\u03c9\u03c3\u03af\u03b1 (Ros\u00eda).\n\nThe first East Slavic state, Kievan Rus', arose in the 9th century, and in 988, it adopted Orthodox Christianity from the Byzantine Empire. The state ultimately disintegrated, with the Grand Duchy of Moscow growing to become the Tsardom of Russia. By the early 18th century, Russia had vastly expanded through conquest, annexation, and exploration, developing into the Russian Empire, which remains the third-largest empire in history.\n\nHowever, with the Russian Revolution in 1917, Russia's monarchic rule was abolished and eventually replaced by the Russian SFSR\u2014the world's first constitutionally socialist state.

The planet has also been a significant celestial body in various cultures. In Chinese, the planet is called J\u012bn-x\u012bng, the golden planet of the metal element. Modern Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese cultures refer to the planet literally as the \"metal star\", based on the Five elements. The Maya considered Venus to be the most important celestial body after the Sun and Moon.\n\nThe symbol of a circle with a small cross beneath is the so-called Venus symbol, which represents femininity and is used as the astronomical symbol for Venus.

{"id": "a5c8f17dd3fc021b", "answer": "Kazakhstan, located in Central Asia, is the world's largest landlocked country. The country's terrain extends from the Caspian Sea in the west to the Altay Mountains in the east, and from the plains of Western Siberia in the north to the oases and deserts of Central Asia in the south. The Kazakh Steppe, which occupies one-third of the country, is the world's largest dry steppe region.\n\nThe term 'Kazakh' traditionally referred only to ethnic Kazakhs, but it is increasingly being used to refer to any inhabitant of Kazakhstan. The country's culture reflects its nomadic heritage, as suggested by the possible origin of the word 'Kazakh' from the Turkic verb 'qaz-', meaning 'to wander'.\n\nKazakhstan's military was largely inherited from the Soviet Armed Forces' Turkestan Military District. The country also maintains a small naval force on the Caspian Sea. Kazakhstan hosts the joint tactical peacekeeping exercise \"Steppe Eagle\" and has sent officers to support United Nations Peacekeeping forces in various locations.\n\nFootball is the most popular sport in Kazakhstan, and the country's national basketball team has been competitive at the continental level. The country's film industry is run through the state-owned Kazakhfilm studios based in Almaty, which has produced award-winning movies.\n\nIn terms of economy, Kazakhstan ranked 25th globally in the 2020 Doing Business Report by the World Bank and was recognized as the best country globally for protecting minority investors' rights.

{"id": "502665955941c8c1", "answer": "Magic Kingdom Park is a theme park at the Walt Disney World Resort in Bay Lake, Florida. It opened on October 1, 1971, and is owned and operated by The Walt Disney Company through its Experiences division. The park was initialized by Walt Disney and designed by WED Enterprises. The park layout and attractions were based on Disneyland Park in Anaheim, California, and are dedicated to fairy tales and Disney characters.\n\nThe park icon is Cinderella Castle, inspired by the fairy tale castle featured in the 1950 animated film. In 2022, the park hosted 17.13 million visitors, making it the most visited theme park in the world for the sixteenth consecutive year and the most visited theme park in North America for at least the past twenty-two years. The park has become a cultural touchstone and symbol of modern American pop culture.\n\nThe park is divided into several themed areas: Main Street, U.S.A., Adventureland, Frontierland, Liberty Square, Storybook Circus, Fantasyland, and Tomorrowland. Each area features various attractions, rides, and points of interest. For example, Adventureland includes attractions like Jungle Cruise, The Magic Carpets of Aladdin, Pirates of the Caribbean, and Swiss Family Treehouse.\n\nMagic Kingdom has also been the subject of various media, including a planned film and television series. In 2012, Jon Favreau announced plans for a film called \"Magic Kingdom\". In 2021, it was announced that a new project, now developed as a television series for Disney+, would see the various lands in the Magic Kingdom as gateways to alternate worlds, setting up a shared universe.

{"id": "663a56fd2372e2f7", "answer": "The economy of Luxembourg is largely dependent on the banking, steel, and industrial sectors. Citizens of Luxembourg enjoy the second highest per capita gross domestic product in the world, according to an IMF estimate in 2022. Although Luxembourg in tourist literature is aptly called the \"Green Heart of Europe\", its pastoral land coexists with a highly industrialized and export-intensive area. Luxembourg's economy is quite similar to Germany's. Luxembourg enjoys a degree of economic prosperity very rare among industrialized democracies.\n\nBanking is the largest sector in the Luxembourg economy. In the 2019 Global Financial Centres Index, Luxembourg was ranked as having the 25th most competitive financial center in the world, and third most competitive in Europe after London and Z\u00fcrich. The country has specialized in the cross-border fund administration business. As Luxembourg's domestic market is relatively small, the country's financial centre is predominantly international. At the end of March 2009, there were 152 banks in Luxembourg, with over 27,000 employees. Political stability, good communications, easy access to other European centres, skilled multilingual staff, a tradition of banking secrecy and cross-border financial expertise have all contributed to the growth of the financial sector.\n\nTourism is an important component of the national economy, representing about 8.3% of GDP in 2009 and employing some 25,000 people or 11.7% of the working population. Despite the current crisis, the Grand Duchy still welcomes over 900,000 visitors a year who spend an average of 2.5 nights in hotels, hostels or on camping sites. Business travel is flourishing representing 44% of overnight stays in the country and 60% in the capital, up 11% and 25% between 2009 and 2010.\n\nLuxembourg's small but productive agricultural sector is highly subsidized, mainly by the EU and the government. It employs about 1\u20133% of the workforce. Most farmers are engaged in dairy and meat production. Vineyards in the Moselle Valley annually produce about 15 million litres of dry white wine, most of which is consumed within Luxembourg and also in Germany, France, and Belgium on a lesser scale.\n\nIn 2013 the GDP was $60.54 billion of which services, including the financial sector, produced 86%. The financial sector comprised 36% of GDP, industry comprised 13.3% and agriculture only 0.3%.\n\nLuxembourg has efficient road, rail and air transport facilities and services. The road network has been significantly modernised in recent years with 147\u00a0km of motorways connecting the capital to adjacent countries. The advent of the high-speed TGV link to Paris has led to renovation of the city's railway station while a new passenger terminal at Luxembourg Airport has recently been opened. The airport has known a sustained growth in passenger numbers during the last years (2015: 2.7 mio, 2020\u00a0: 4 mio expected), and the second stage of expansion is on its way. Trams have been reintroduced to the capital (first core line operative in end 2017) and further lines are planned, including a tram/light-rail to Esch-sur-Alzette. In 2019, almost all public transport was made free to use for both residents and visitors.\n\nIn 2022, the sector with the highest number of companies registered in Luxembourg is Finance, Insurance, and Real Estate with 89,748 companies followed by Services and Retail Trade with 31,658 and 6,571 companies respectively.\n\nSince the Holding Act of 1929, Luxembourg has been an attractive location for tax avoidance. A network of lawyers, bankers and political elites have since then maintained an infrastructure of regulatory codes, legal expertise and shell companies that enable tax avoidance. Concern about Luxembourg's banking secrecy laws, and its reputation as a tax haven, led in April 2009 to it being added to a \"grey list\" of nations with questionable banking arrangements by the G20, a list from which it was removed in 2009. This concern has led Luxembourg to modify its tax legislation to avoid conflict with the tax authorities of European Union Members. For example, the classic tax exempt 1929 Holding Company was outlawed 31 December 2010, as it was deemed an illegal state aid by the European Commission.\n\nThe restructuring of the industry and increasing government ownership in Arbed (31%) began as early as 1974. As a result of timely modernization of facilities, cutbacks in production and employment, government assumption of portions of Arbed's debt, and recent cyclical recovery of the international demand for steel, the company is again profitable. Its productivity is among the highest in the world. US markets account for about 6% of Arbed's output. The company specializes in production of large architectural steel beams and specialized value-added products. There has been, however, a relative decline in the steel sector, offset by Luxembourg's emergence as a financial center. In 2001, through the merger with Aceralia and Usinor, Arbed became Arcelor. Arcelor was taken over in 2006 by Mittal Steel to form Arcelor-Mittal, helmed by Lakshmi Mittal, the largest steel producer in the world.", "question": {"id": "663a56fd2372e2f7", "question": "Who are the top import partners of the five countries or territories with the highest GDP per capita, including non-IMF members, in 2022?", "necessary_evidence": [{"pageid": 695403, "revid": 1184371248, "title": "List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(PPP)_per_capita"}, {"pageid": 17834, "revid": 1185796524, "title": "Economy of Luxembourg", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Luxembourg"}, {"pageid": 18933019, "revid": 1185002235, "title": "Economy of the Republic of Ireland", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_Republic_of_Ireland"}, {"pageid": 57011, "revid": 1185760381, "title": "Economy of Singapore", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Singapore"}, {"pageid": 25191, "revid": 1181711237, "title": "Economy of Qatar", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Qatar"}, {"pageid": 57615, "revid": 1182585181, "title": "Economy of Norway", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Norway"}], "categories": ["Economics", "International Relations"]}}

{"id": "5d785bba74574085", "answer": "The Nile is a major north-flowing river in northeastern Africa. It's considered the longest river in Africa and is disputed as the longest river in the world. The river's drainage basin covers eleven countries: Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, Ethiopia, Eritrea, South Sudan, Republic of the Sudan, and Egypt. The Nile has two major tributaries \u2013 the White Nile and the Blue Nile.

However, the etymology beyond that is disputed. Ancient Greek authors referred to its lower course as \"Neilos\", and this term became generalized for the entire river system.

The band also explored music styles ranging from folk and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock. As pioneers in recording, songwriting, and artistic presentation, the Beatles revolutionised many aspects of the music industry and were often publicised as leaders of the era's youth and sociocultural movements.\n\nThe band's concert at San Francisco's Candlestick Park on 29 August 1966 was their last commercial concert. It marked the end of four years dominated by almost non-stop touring that included over 1,400 concert appearances internationally. After this, they focused more on studio work, producing albums like *Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band*.\n\nOn 8 May 1970, *Let It Be* was released. Its accompanying single, \"The Long and Winding Road\", was expected to be the Beatles' last; it was released in the US, but not in the UK. The *Let It Be* documentary film followed later that month, and would win the 1970 Academy Award for Best Original Song Score.\n\nIn 2010, the official canon of thirteen Beatles studio albums, *Past Masters*, and the \"Red\" and \"Blue\" greatest-hits albums were made available on iTunes.", "question": {"id": "e8a282e9118beb1c", "question": "Who are the principal members of the rock band that created the song 'Hey Jude', and what are their dates of birth?", "necessary_evidence": [{"pageid": 155452, "revid": 1185773816, "title": "Hey Jude", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hey_Jude"}, {"pageid": 29812, "revid": 1185888175, "title": "The Beatles", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles"}, {"pageid": 15852, "revid": 1185205322, "title": "John Lennon", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lennon"}, {"pageid": 13736167, "revid": 1185870658, "title": "Paul McCartney", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_McCartney"}, {"pageid": 12731, "revid": 1185362107, "title": "George Harrison", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Harrison"}, {"pageid": 25832, "revid": 1185729491, "title": "Ringo Starr", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ringo_Starr"}], "categories": ["Music"]}}

{"id": "e0cf5fbb55859077", "answer": "T-Series is an Indian music record label and film production company founded by Gulshan Kumar on 11 July 1983. It is primarily known for Hindi film soundtracks and Indi-pop music. As of 2014, T-Series is India's largest music record label, with up to a 35% share of the Indian music market, followed by Sony Music India and Zee Music. T-Series also owns and operates the most-viewed and the most-subscribed YouTube channel, with over 252 million subscribers and 236 billion total views as of 2 November 2023. While best known as a music label, T-Series has also had some moderate success as a film production company.\n\nOn YouTube, T-Series has a multi-channel network, with 30 channels that have over 382.3 million subscribers as of 15 December 2021. The company's YouTube team consists of 13 people at the T-Series headquarters. The company's main T-Series channel on YouTube primarily shows music videos as well as film trailers. It became the most-viewed YouTube channel in January 2017. The T-Series channel primarily features content in the Hindi language, and occasionally several other languages including Bhojpuri, Punjabi, and English. T-Series also have other channels dedicated to content in several Indian languages including Bengali, Bhojpuri, Punjabi, Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, Kannada, Gujarati, Marathi, and Rajasthani.\n\nAs a film production company, T-Series has had some moderate success. The highest-grossing T-Series film production to date is the critically acclaimed sleeper hit Hindi Medium (2017), which grossed \u20b9322.4 crore ($44 million) worldwide, with $34 million in China alone, becoming one of the top 20 highest-grossing Indian films of all time. One of the most expensive Indian films was T-Series's Saaho, a sci-fi thriller with a production budget of \u20b9300 crore (equivalent to \u20b9373 crore or US$47 million in 2023), released in 2019.\n\nT-Series' first original film soundtrack release was for Lallu Ram in 1984, with music scored by Ravindra Jain. The company's breakthrough came when it released the soundtrack for the 1988 film Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak (also known as QSQT), which became the best-selling Indian soundtrack album of 1988 and one of the best-selling Indian soundtrack albums of the 1980s, with more than 8 million units sold. The biggest hit song from the album was \"Papa Kehte Hain\", sung by Udit Narayan and picturised on Aamir Khan. T-Series founder Gulshan Kumar soon played a key role in Hindi film music's cassette boom of the late 1980s with his affordable T-Series albums.\n\nThe growth of T-Series' YouTube channel has been attributed to India's emerging online population. India currently has 500 million Internet users and this number is expected to grow rapidly. A major breakthrough in India's Internet growth came in September 2016 with the advent of 4G network Reliance Jio, offering data at very low costs. India has since emerged as the world's second-largest online population (behind China, where YouTube is blocked), with YouTube alone having over 225 million monthly Indian users. India's high demand for YouTube content and the lack of local content creators has contributed significantly to the rapid growth of T-Series.", "question": {"id": "e0cf5fbb55859077", "question": "When were the companies behind the current five most subscribed YouTube brand channels founded?", "necessary_evidence": [{"pageid": 40199886, "revid": 1185924728, "title": "List of most-subscribed YouTube channels", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most-subscribed_YouTube_channels"}, {"pageid": 21844874, "revid": 1185743653, "title": "T-Series (company)", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-Series_(company)"}, {"pageid": 58728524, "revid": 1185359161, "title": "Cocomelon", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocomelon"}, {"pageid": 1429265, "revid": 1182843124, "title": "Sony Entertainment Television", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Entertainment_Television"}, {"pageid": 60765722, "revid": 1185417019, "title": "Kids Diana Show", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kids_Diana_Show"}, {"pageid": 53813465, "revid": 1185932096, "title": "Zee Music Company", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zee_Music_Company"}], "categories": ["Business", "Internet"]}}

{"id": "e1e7f906fc9826ad", "answer": "Hawaii, also known as the Big Island or Hawai\u02bbi Island, is the largest island in the United States and is located in the state of Hawaii. It is the southeasternmost of the Hawaiian Islands, a chain of volcanic islands in the North Pacific Ocean. With an area of 4,028 square miles (10,430\u00a0km2), it has 63% of the Hawaiian archipelago's combined landmass. However, it only has 13% of the archipelago's population. The island of Hawai\u02bbi is the third largest island in Polynesia, behind the north and south islands of New Zealand.\n\nThe island is often referred to as the Island of Hawai\u02bbi or Hawai\u02bbi Island to distinguish it from the state. It is also referred to as the Big Island. To distinguish it without relying on English, it is sometimes called Moku o Keawe. In Hawaiian, the word keawe has several meanings, one definition; southern cross and is said to be the name of an ancient chief as well as a second definition; \"the bearer\" (ke-a-we). Administratively, the island is coextensive with Hawaii County.\n\nAs of the 2020 census, the population was 200,629. The county seat and largest town is Hilo. There are no incorporated cities in Hawai\u02bbi County.\n\nThe island is home to one of the United States' largest cattle ranches: Parker Ranch, on 175,000 acres (708\u00a0km2) in Waimea. The island is also known for astronomy, with numerous telescopes operated on the summit of Mauna Kea at the Mauna Kea Observatories, where atmospheric clarity is excellent and there is little light pollution.\n\nBecause Mauna Loa and K\u012blauea are fairly active volcanoes, the island of Hawaii is still growing. Between January 1983 and September 2002, lava flows added 543 acres (220\u00a0ha) to the island. Lava flowing from K\u012blauea has destroyed several towns, including Kapoho in 1960 and again in 2018, and Kalapana and Kaim\u016b in 1990. In 1987 lava filled in \"Queen's Bath\", a large, L-shaped, freshwater pool in the Kalapana area. Another 875 acres were added between May and July, 2018 by the 2018 lower Puna eruption.

{"id": "a0aad4e6d1b78318", "answer": "Dean P. Baquet served as the executive editor of The New York Times from May 2014 to June 2022. He is the first Black person to have been executive editor. Baquet began his journalism career at the New Orleans States-Item, which later merged with The Times-Picayune. After six years at the Times-Picayune, he joined the Chicago Tribune in 1984, where he won the Pulitzer Prize, before joining The New York Times in April 1990 as an investigative reporter on the Metro desk. In 2000, he joined the Los Angeles Times as managing editor, working as editor John Carroll's \"right-hand man\". Baquet became the top editor in 2005 after Carroll resigned amid clashes with the Tribune Company, which had acquired the Los Angeles Times from the Chandler family in 2000. He was the first Black person to serve as the newspaper's top editor. Baquet was fired in 2006 after he publicly opposed plans to cut newsroom jobs.\n\nMatt Murray served as the editor in chief of The Wall Street Journal from 2018 until 2023.

He was deputy managing editor, then executive editor. On June 5, 2018, Murray was named editor in chief, succeeding Gerard Baker, and assumed his new role on June 11. As editor in chief, Murray oversaw the Wall Street Journal investigations into Michael Cohen and the Stormy Daniels\u2013Donald Trump scandal that led to the Journal's Pulitzer win in 2019. In February 2020, amid backlash from the Chinese government regarding the headline of a Wall Street Journal opinion piece, Murray agreed with the complaints but could not take any action due to the separation between news and opinion at the paper. In the wake of the murder of George Floyd and subsequent protests, journalists at the Journal sent multiple letters to Murray lamenting the paper's lack of diversity as well as demanding changes to the way the paper covers race, policing and finance.

{"id": "f2dd89a51c5163e7", "answer": "Delta Air Lines is one of the major airlines of the United States and a legacy carrier. It is one of the world's oldest airlines in operation, with its headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia. The airline, along with its subsidiaries and regional affiliates, including Delta Connection, operates over 5,400 flights daily and serves 325 destinations in 52 countries on six continents. Delta is a founding member of the SkyTeam airline alliance. As of the end of 2022, it had 90,000 employees.\n\nThe history of Delta Air Lines began with the world's first aerial crop dusting operation called Huff Daland Dusters, Inc. The company was founded on March 2, 1925, in Macon, Georgia, before moving to Monroe, Louisiana, in summer 1925. It flew a Huff-Daland Duster, the first true crop duster, designed to combat the boll weevil infestation of cotton crops. C.E. Woolman, general manager and later Delta's first CEO, led a group of local investors to acquire the company's assets. Delta Air Service was incorporated on December 3, 1928, and was named after the Mississippi Delta region.\n\nAs of December 2020, Delta operated a fleet of 750 aircraft manufactured by Airbus and Boeing. Delta operates the largest Boeing 717, Boeing 757, and Boeing 767 fleets in the world, and the largest Airbus A330 fleet of any US airline. Prior to its 2008 merger with Northwest Airlines, Delta's fleet was made up of solely Boeing and McDonnell Douglas aircraft. Airbus aircraft from Northwest joined the fleet after the merger, and more have since been added.\n\nDelta has nine hubs, with Atlanta being its largest in terms of total passengers and number of departures. It is ranked second among the world's largest airlines by number of passengers carried, passenger-miles flown, and fleet size. It is ranked first by revenue for commercially owned airline companies as well as in brand value, and 113th on the Fortune 500.", "question": {"id": "f2dd89a51c5163e7", "question": "What are the top 5 richest airlines in the world and when were they founded?", "necessary_evidence": [{"pageid": 1374854, "revid": 1184819091, "title": "Largest airlines in the world", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Largest_airlines_in_the_world"}, {"pageid": 77549, "revid": 1185642477, "title": "Delta Air Lines", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_Air_Lines"}, {"pageid": 38521579, "revid": 1184352968, "title": "American Airlines Group", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Airlines_Group"}, {"pageid": 27686819, "revid": 1181052288, "title": "United Airlines Holdings", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Airlines_Holdings"}, {"pageid": 97733, "revid": 1184682688, "title": "Lufthansa", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lufthansa_Group"}, {"pageid": 357689, "revid": 1185814094, "title": "Air France\u2013KLM", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_France%E2%80%93KLM"}], "categories": ["History", "Business"]}}

{"id": "b31e39b56af586a2", "answer": "The history of Mesopotamia ranges from the earliest human occupation in the Paleolithic period up to Late antiquity. This history is pieced together from evidence retrieved from archaeological excavations and, after the introduction of writing in the late 4th millennium BC, an increasing amount of historical sources. While in the Paleolithic and early Neolithic periods only parts of Upper Mesopotamia were occupied, the southern alluvium was settled during the late Neolithic period. Mesopotamia has been home to many of the oldest major civilizations, entering history from the Early Bronze Age, for which reason it is often called a cradle of civilization.\n\nThe Fertile Crescent was inhabited by several distinct, flourishing cultures between the end of the last ice age (c. 10,000 BC) and the beginning of history. One of the oldest known Neolithic sites in Mesopotamia is Jarmo, settled around 7000 BC and broadly contemporary with Jericho (in the Levant) and \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck (in Anatolia). It as well as other early Neolithic sites, such as Samarra and Tell Halaf were in northern Mesopotamia; later settlements in southern Mesopotamia required complicated irrigation methods. The first of these was Eridu, settled during the Ubaid period culture by farmers who brought with them the Samarran culture from the north.\n\nThe Akkadian Empire lost power after the reign of Naram-Sin, and eventually was invaded by the Guti from the Zagros Mountains. For half a century the Guti controlled Mesopotamia, especially the south, but they left few inscriptions, so they are not well understood. The Guti hold loosened on southern Mesopotamia, where the second dynasty of Lagash came into prominence. Its most famous ruler was Gudea, who left many statues of himself in temples across Sumer.\n\nBy 1300 BC the Hurrians had been reduced to their homelands in Asia Minor after their power was broken by the Assyrians and Hittites, and held the status of vassals to the \"Hatti\", the Hittites, a western Indo-European people (belonging to the linguistic \"centum\" group) who dominated most of Asia Minor (modern Turkey) at this time from their capital of Hattusa. The Hittites came into conflict with the Assyrians from the mid-14th to the 13th centuries BC, losing territory to the Assyrian kings of the period. However they endured until being finally swept aside by the Phrygians, who conquered their homelands in Asia Minor. The Phrygians were prevented from moving south into Mesopotamia by the Assyrian king Tiglath-Pileser I. The Hittites fragmented into a number of small Neo-Hittite states, which endured in the region for many centuries.\n\nRecords from the 12th and 11th centuries BC are sparse in Babylonia, which had been overrun with new Semitic settlers, namely the Arameans, Chaldeans and Sutu. Assyria however, remained a compact and strong nation, which continued to provide much written record. The 10th century BC is even worse for Babylonia, with very few inscriptions. Mesopotamia was not alone in this obscurity: the Hittite Empire fell at the beginning of this period and very few records are known from Egypt and Elam. This was a time of invasion and upheaval by many new people throughout the Near East, North Africa, The Caucasus, Mediterranean and Balkan regions.", "question": {"id": "b31e39b56af586a2", "question": "Which five cities of the world's oldest civilization were the first to exercise kingship and where are they currently located geographically?", "necessary_evidence": [{"pageid": 6258, "revid": 1184628676, "title": "Civilization", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilization"}, {"pageid": 50521, "revid": 1185207825, "title": "Sumer", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumer"}, {"pageid": 42617, "revid": 1185091192, "title": "Eridu", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eridu"}, {"pageid": 1368502, "revid": 1171214296, "title": "Bad-tibira", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad-tibira"}, {"pageid": 43350468, "revid": 1141912058, "title": "Larak (Sumer)", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larak_(Sumer)"}, {"pageid": 85480, "revid": 1174794947, "title": "Sippar", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sippar"}, {"pageid": 1368568, "revid": 1184747936, "title": "Shuruppak", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuruppak"}], "categories": ["History", "Geography"]}}

Over the years, the collection has also been released on cassette, 8-track, compact disc (CD), on a USB flash drive in MP3 and 24-bit FLAC format, and on digital media streaming services. The Beatles' UK discography was first released on CD in 1987 and 1988. Between 1962 and 1968, the Beatles released their songs in both mono and stereo versions. The band's catalogue was remastered in both mono and stereo in 2009.\n\nThe Beatles' core catalogue was harmonised worldwide to encompass their 12 original UK studio albums, the 1967 US *Magical Mystery Tour* album and the newly assembled *Past Masters: Volumes One and Two* compilation albums consisting of all the studio recordings released during 1962 to 1970 that are not present on the UK studio albums or *Magical Mystery Tour* (mainly non-album singles, B-sides and EP tracks). When the core catalogue was reissued in remastered editions in 2009, the two volumes of *Past Masters* were combined into one double album. Since then, other past releases have been reissued in digital formats and on vinyl. The catalogue is currently distributed by Universal Music Enterprises' Calderstone Productions.

{"id": "df8f21d3fad3485e", "answer": "Sicily, the largest and most populous island in the Mediterranean Sea, is officially referred to as Regione Siciliana and is one of the five Italian autonomous regions. The island has 4.8 million inhabitants and its capital city is Palermo. The island is named after the Sicels, who inhabited the eastern part of the island during the Iron Age.\n\nToday in Sicily most people are bilingual and speak both Italian and Sicilian, a distinct and historical Romance language. Some of the Sicilian words are loan words from Greek, Catalan, Norman, French, Arabic, Spanish and other languages. Dialects related to Sicilian are also spoken in Calabria and Salento; it had a significant influence on the Maltese language. However, the use of Sicilian is limited to informal contexts (mostly in family) and in a majority of cases it is replaced by the so-called regional Italian of Sicily, an Italian dialect that is a kind of mix between Italian and Sicilian.\n\nOther languages are spoken in Sicily as well. Within the province of Palermo, four towns are home to speakers of Arb\u00ebr\u00ebsh varieties. Arb\u00ebr\u00ebsh is the name given to varieties of Albanian spoken in Italy. In the eastern part of the island, there are Gallo-Italic varieties known as Gallo-Italic of Sicily, which are related to the other Gallo-Italic languages spoken in most of northern Italy and in other isolated pockets of southern Italy.\n\nHistorically, Sicily has been influenced by a variety of cultures and languages. The Arabs initiated land reforms, which increased productivity and encouraged the growth of smallholdings, undermining the dominance of the latifundia. The Arabs further improved irrigation systems. The language spoken in Sicily under Arab rule was Siculo-Arabic and Arabic influence is present in some Sicilian words today. Although long extinct in Sicily, the language has developed into what is now the Maltese language on the islands of Malta today.\n\nThe Normans also introduced their own culture, customs, and politics in the region. Many Normans in Sicily adopted the habits and comportment of Muslim rulers and their Byzantine subjects in dress, language, literature, even to the extent of having palace eunuchs and, according to some accounts, a harem.\n\n", "question": {"id": "df8f21d3fad3485e", "question": "What languages are spoken on the four largest islands in the Mediterranean?", "necessary_evidence": [{"pageid": 376710, "revid": 1183440121, "title": "List of islands in the Mediterranean", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_islands_in_the_Mediterranean"}, {"pageid": 467199, "revid": 1181836639, "title": "Sicilian language", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicilian_language#:~:text=Sicilian%20(Sicilian%3A%20sicilianu%2C%20pronounced,in%20Italian%20italiano%20meridionale%20estremo).&text=This%20article%20contains%20IPA%20phonetic%20symbols."}, {"pageid": 27034, "revid": 1185873513, "title": "Sardinian language", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sardinian_language"}, {"pageid": 15735429, "revid": 1185812268, "title": "Languages of Cyprus", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_Cyprus"}, {"pageid": 7578, "revid": 1182635246, "title": "Corsican language", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corsican_language"}], "categories": ["Linguistics", "Geography"]}}

His time at PSG has been marked by some criticism and he has faced accusations of not performing to his usual standards. Despite this, he has continued to show his quality on the pitch and remains one of the top players in the world.\n\nMessi has also had a successful international career with Argentina.

{"id": "8d34c2d397c3cbc4", "answer": "The State of Palestine refers to a de jure sovereign state in the Middle East recognized by 138 of the 193 United Nations (UN) member states and by the UN as an observer state, after the declaration of independence proclaimed by the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) on 15 November 1988 in Algiers, Algeria, at an extraordinary session in-exile of the Palestinian National Council. The declaration was promptly acknowledged by a range of countries, and by the end of 1988, proclaimed Palestinian state was recognized by 78 countries. As of 31 July 2019, 138 of the 193 United Nations (UN) member states and two non-member states have recognized it. Palestine also has been a non-member observer state of the UN General Assembly since the passing of United Nations General Assembly resolution 67/19 in November 2012. Palestine also is a member of the Arab League, Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, G77, and the International Olympic Committee and other international bodies.\n\nThe areas claimed by the State of Palestine lie in the Southern Levant. The Gaza Strip borders the Mediterranean Sea to the west, Egypt to the south, and Israel to the north and east. The West Bank is bordered by Jordan to the east, and Israel to the north, south, and west. Thus, the two enclaves constituting the area claimed by State of Palestine have no geographical border with one another, being separated by Israel. These areas would constitute the world's 163rd largest country by land area.\n\nThe UN has permitted Palestine to title its representative office to the UN as \"The Permanent Observer Mission of the State of Palestine to the United Nations\", and Palestine has instructed its diplomats to officially represent \"The State of Palestine\"\u2014no longer the Palestinian National Authority. On 17 December 2012, UN Chief of Protocol Yeocheol Yoon declared that \"the designation of 'State of Palestine' shall be used by the Secretariat in all official United Nations documents\", thus recognising the title 'State of Palestine' as the state's official name for all UN purposes.", "question": {"id": "8d34c2d397c3cbc4", "question": "What are the seven smallest countries on Earth's most populous continent and what are the capitals of these countries?", "necessary_evidence": [{"pageid": 19630739, "revid": 1185821688, "title": "Continent", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continent"}, {"pageid": 689, "revid": 1185632983, "title": "Asia", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia"}, {"pageid": 19117, "revid": 1185750716, "title": "Maldives", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maldives"}, {"pageid": 27318, "revid": 1185356760, "title": "Singapore", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore"}, {"pageid": 18933277, "revid": 1185880801, "title": "Bahrain", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahrain"}, {"pageid": 3466, "revid": 1184892368, "title": "Brunei", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brunei"}, {"pageid": 241405, "revid": 1185658213, "title": "State of Palestine", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_Palestine"}, {"pageid": 5593, "revid": 1185799368, "title": "Cyprus", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyprus"}, {"pageid": 17771, "revid": 1185834188, "title": "Lebanon", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon"}], "categories": ["Geography"]}}
{"id": "d3c2da780ba99718", "answer": "The Mississippi River is the primary river, and second-longest river, of the largest drainage basin in the United States. From its traditional source of Lake Itasca in northern Minnesota, it flows generally south for 2,340 miles (3,766 km) to the Mississippi River Delta in the Gulf of Mexico. With its many tributaries, the Mississippi's watershed drains all or parts of 32 U.S. states and two Canadian provinces between the Rocky and Appalachian mountains. The main stem is entirely within the United States; the total drainage basin is 1,151,000 sq mi (2,980,000 km2), of which only about one percent is in Canada. The Mississippi ranks as the thirteenth-largest river by discharge in the world. The river either borders or passes through the states of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Louisiana.\n\nThe Mississippi River can be divided into three sections: the Upper Mississippi, the river from its headwaters to the confluence with the Missouri River; the Middle Mississippi, which is downriver from the Missouri to the Ohio River; and the Lower Mississippi, which flows from the Ohio to the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nThe area of the Mississippi River basin was first settled by hunting and gathering Native American peoples and is considered one of the few independent centers of plant domestication in human history. Evidence of early cultivation of sunflower, a goosefoot, a marsh elder and an indigenous squash dates to the 4th millennium BC. The lifestyle gradually became more settled after around 1000 BC during what is now called the Woodland period, with increasing evidence of shelter construction, pottery, weaving and other practices.\n\nIn 1519 Spanish explorer Alonso \u00c1lvarez de Pineda became the first recorded European to reach the Mississippi River, followed by Hernando de Soto who reached the river on May 8, 1541, and called it R\u00edo del Esp\u00edritu Santo (\"River of the Holy Spirit\"), in the area of what is now Mississippi. In Spanish, the river is called R\u00edo Mississippi.", "question": {"id": "d3c2da780ba99718", "question": "Through which states does the longest river in the United States of America run, and in what years were those states founded?", "necessary_evidence": [{"pageid": 30996372, "revid": 1185652480, "title": "List of longest rivers of the United States (by main stem)", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_longest_rivers_of_the_United_States_(by_main_stem)"}, {"pageid": 19591, "revid": 1180899700, "title": "Missouri River", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri_River"}, {"pageid": 19978, "revid": 1180753026, "title": "Montana", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montana"}, {"pageid": 21651, "revid": 1185505885, "title": "North Dakota", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Dakota"}, {"pageid": 26746, "revid": 1184391655, "title": "South Dakota", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota"}, {"pageid": 21647, "revid": 1182933087, "title": "Nebraska", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebraska"}, {"pageid": 26810748, "revid": 1185872603, "title": "Iowa", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa"}, {"pageid": 16716, "revid": 1185621775, "title": "Kansas", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas"}, {"pageid": 19571, "revid": 1185461737, "title": "Missouri", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri"}], "categories": ["History", "Geography"]}}

{"id": "3de61f35c2643426", "answer": "The currency of Canada is the Canadian dollar (symbol: $; code: CAD; French: dollar canadien). It is abbreviated with the dollar sign $, and the abbreviations Can$, CA$, and C$ are frequently used for distinction from other dollar-denominated currencies. The Canadian dollar is divided into 100 cents (\u00a2). The dollar coin, and sometimes the unit of currency itself, may be referred to as the \"loonie\" by English-speaking Canadians and foreign exchange traders and analysts, owing to the image of a common loon on its reverse.\n\nThe Canadian dollar is the sixth-most held reserve currency in the world, accounting for approximately 2% of all global reserves. It is popular with central banks because of Canada's relative economic soundness, the Canadian government's strong sovereign position, and the stability of the country's legal and political systems.\n\nThe Bank of Canada currently has no specific target value for the Canadian dollar and has not intervened in foreign exchange markets since 1998. The Bank's official position is that market conditions should determine the worth of the Canadian dollar, although it occasionally makes minor attempts to influence its value.\n\nIn recent years, dramatic fluctuations in the value of the Canadian dollar have tended to correlate with shifts in oil prices, reflecting the Canadian dollar's status as a petrocurrency owing to Canada's significant oil exports.", "question": {"id": "3de61f35c2643426", "question": "What are the countries that make up the G7 international political & economic forum and what form of currency does each country use?", "necessary_evidence": [{"pageid": 1196634, "revid": 1185575195, "title": "G7", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G7"}, {"pageid": 5042916, "revid": 1185732441, "title": "Canada", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada"}, {"pageid": 5843419, "revid": 1185856656, "title": "France", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France"}, {"pageid": 11867, "revid": 1185869364, "title": "Germany", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany"}, {"pageid": 14532, "revid": 1185928833, "title": "Italy", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy"}, {"pageid": 15573, "revid": 1185720931, "title": "Japan", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"}, {"pageid": 31717, "revid": 1185578678, "title": "United Kingdom", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"}, {"pageid": 3434750, "revid": 1185914171, "title": "United States", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"}], "categories": ["Economics", "Political Science"]}}

He is the first prime minister outside of the Indian National Congress to win two consecutive terms with a full majority and the second to complete more than five years in office after Atal Bihari Vajpayee.\n\nModi's administration has tried to raise foreign direct investment in the Indian economy and reduced spending on healthcare and social welfare programs. Modi has attempted to improve efficiency in the bureaucracy; he has centralized power by abolishing the Planning Commission. He began a high-profile sanitation campaign and weakened or abolished environmental and labor laws.\n\nUnder his tenure, India has experienced democratic backsliding. Following his party's victory in the 2019 general election, his administration revoked the special status of Jammu and Kashmir. His administration also introduced the Citizenship Amendment Act, which resulted in widespread protests across the country.

{"id": "64de8aa91bb97ec6", "answer": "The fall of the Western Roman Empire was a process in which the Empire failed to enforce its rule, and its vast territory was divided into several successor polities. The Roman Empire lost the strengths that had allowed it to exercise effective control over its Western provinces; modern historians mention factors including the effectiveness and numbers of the army, the health and numbers of the Roman population, the strength of the economy, the competence of the Emperors, the internal struggles for power, the religious changes of the period, and the efficiency of the civil administration. Increasing pressure from invading barbarians outside Roman culture also contributed greatly to the collapse. The reasons for the collapse are major subjects of the historiography of the ancient world and they inform much modern discourse on state failure.\n\nThe main timeline of the fall of the Western Roman Empire is as follows:\n\n- In 475, Orestes, a former secretary of Attila, drove Julius Nepos out of Ravenna and proclaimed his own son Flavius Momyllus Romulus Augustus (Romulus Augustulus) as Emperor, on October 31. His surname 'Augustus' was given the diminutive form 'Augustulus' by rivals, because he was still a minor. Romulus was never recognized outside Italy as a legitimate ruler.\n- In 476, Orestes refused to honor his promises of land to his mercenaries, who revolted under the leadership of Odoacer. Orestes was captured and executed on August 28, 476.\n- On September 4, 476, Odoacer forced Romulus Augustulus, whom his father Orestes had proclaimed to be Rome's Emperor, to abdicate. Odoacer installed himself as ruler over Italy, and sent the Imperial insignia to Constantinople. This is traditionally marked as the end of the Western Roman Empire.", "question": {"id": "64de8aa91bb97ec6", "question": "What were the dates of five key historical events: the signing of the Magna Carta, the fall of the Roman Empire, the start of the Renaissance, the discovery of America, and the first moon landing?", "necessary_evidence": [{"pageid": 20958, "revid": 1181111347, "title": "Magna Carta", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magna_Carta"}, {"pageid": 923406, "revid": 1179657806, "title": "Fall of the Western Roman Empire", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_the_Western_Roman_Empire"}, {"pageid": 25532, "revid": 1185873785, "title": "Renaissance", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance"}, {"pageid": 690842, "revid": 1183785009, "title": "Age of Discovery", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Discovery"}, {"pageid": 662, "revid": 1182626201, "title": "Apollo 11", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_11"}], "categories": ["History"]}}
{"id": "44fb78a536216961", "answer": "The Louvre, or the Louvre Museum, is a national art museum in Paris, France. It is located on the Right Bank of the Seine in the city's 1st arrondissement and is home to some of the most canonical works of Western art, including the Mona Lisa and the Venus de Milo. The museum is housed in the Louvre Palace, originally built in the late 12th to 13th century under Philip II. Remnants of the Medieval Louvre fortress are visible in the basement of the museum. Due to urban expansion, the fortress eventually lost its defensive function, and in 1546 Francis I converted it into the primary residence of the French Kings.\n\nThe Louvre is involved in controversies that surround cultural property seized under Napoleon I, as well as during World War II by the Nazis. In the early 2010s, workers' rights in the construction of Louvre Abu Dhabi were also a point of controversy for the museum.\n\nDuring World War II, the Louvre conducted an elaborate plan of evacuation of its art collection. When Germany occupied the Sudetenland, many important artworks such as the Mona Lisa were temporarily moved to the Ch\u00e2teau de Chambord. When war was formally declared a year later, most of the museum's paintings were sent there as well. Select sculptures such as Winged Victory of Samothrace and the Venus de Milo were sent to the Ch\u00e2teau de Valen\u00e7ay. On 27 August 1939, after two days of packing, truck convoys began to leave Paris. By 28 December, the museum was cleared of most works, except those that were too heavy and \"unimportant paintings [that] were left in the basement\". In early 1945, after the liberation of France, art began returning to the Louvre.\n\nThe current director of the Louvre is Laurence des Cars, who was selected by French president Emmanuel Macron in 2021. She is the first woman to hold this position. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Louvre has launched a digital platform where most of its works, including those that are not on display, can be seen. The database includes more than 482,000 illustrated records, representing 75% of the Louvre's collections. The museum was visited by over 7.6 million visitors in 2022, up 170 percent from 2021, but still below the 10.8 million visitors in 2018 before the COVID-19 pandemic.", "question": {"id": "44fb78a536216961", "question": "What are the top 5 most-visited museums in 2022 and in what year were each of them established?", "necessary_evidence": [{"pageid": 54754776, "revid": 1176897905, "title": "List of most-visited museums", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most-visited_museums"}, {"pageid": 17546, "revid": 1185684113, "title": "Louvre", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louvre"}, {"pageid": 229765, "revid": 1182366949, "title": "Vatican Museums", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vatican_Museums"}, {"pageid": 310411, "revid": 1185886234, "title": "Natural History Museum, London", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_History_Museum,_London"}, {"pageid": 4675, "revid": 1185391216, "title": "British Museum", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Museum"}, {"pageid": 700610, "revid": 1185485292, "title": "National Museum of Natural History", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Museum_of_Natural_History"}], "categories": ["History", "Tourism", "Art"]}}

{"id": "0446750180203b4f", "answer": "Jupiter is the largest planet in the Solar System, primarily composed of gas and liquid rather than solid matter. It has a diameter of 142,984 km at its equator, which is 1,321 times the volume of Earth. The planet is named after the chief god of the divine pantheon in both ancient Greek and Roman civilizations. The International Astronomical Union formally adopted the name Jupiter for the planet in 1976.\n\nJupiter is a gas giant with an average distance of 778 million km from the Sun and completes an orbit every 11.86 years. The atmospheric proportions of hydrogen and helium are close to the theoretical composition of the primordial solar nebula. Neon in the upper atmosphere only consists of 20 parts per million by mass, which is about a tenth as abundant as in the Sun.\n\nIn 1610, Italian polymath Galileo Galilei discovered the four largest moons of Jupiter (now known as the Galilean moons) using a telescope. This is thought to be the first telescopic observation of moons other than Earth's. The discovery was a major point in favor of Copernicus' heliocentric theory of the motions of the planets.\n\nJupiter currently has 95 known natural satellites, of which 79 are less than 10 km in diameter.

{"id": "5d667eaab77b37ff", "answer": "The isotopes of helium include:\n\n1. **Helium-2 (diproton)**: This is an extremely unstable isotope of helium. Its nucleus, a diproton, consists of two protons with no neutrons. Its instability is due to spin\u2013spin interactions in the nuclear force and to the quantum mechanics described by the Pauli exclusion principle.\n\n2. **Helium-3**: This isotope is stable and is the only stable isotope other than 1H with more protons than neutrons. There is only a trace amount of 3He on Earth, primarily present since the formation of the Earth, although some falls to Earth trapped in cosmic dust. In stars, however, 3He is more abundant, a product of nuclear fusion.\n\n3. **Helium-4**: This is the most common isotope, produced on Earth by alpha decay of heavier radioactive elements. It is an unusually stable nucleus because its nucleons are arranged into complete shells. It was also formed in enormous quantities during Big Bang nucleosynthesis.\n\n4. **Heavier helium isotopes**: All heavier helium isotopes decay with a half-life of less than one second. Researchers have used particle accelerator collisions to create unusual atomic nuclei for elements such as helium, lithium, and nitrogen. The unusual nuclear structures of such isotopes may offer insights into the isolated properties of neutrons and physics beyond the Standard Model.\n\nThe isotopic abundance of helium varies greatly depending on its origin. In the Earth's atmosphere, the ratio of 3He to 4He is 1.343(13)\u00d710\u22126. However, in the Local Interstellar Cloud, the proportion of 3He to 4He is 1.62(29)\u00d710\u22124, which is 121(22) times higher than that of atmospheric helium. Rocks from the Earth's crust have isotope ratios varying by as much as a factor of ten. This is used in geology to investigate the origin of rocks and the composition of the Earth's mantle.", "question": {"id": "5d667eaab77b37ff", "question": "List all the naturally occurring Noble gases and their stable isotopes.", "necessary_evidence": [{"pageid": 21140, "revid": 1185255471, "title": "Noble gas", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noble_gas"}, {"pageid": 13256, "revid": 1185600362, "title": "Helium", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium"}, {"pageid": 21273, "revid": 1185831148, "title": "Neon", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neon"}, {"pageid": 896, "revid": 1185601353, "title": "Argon", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon"}, {"pageid": 10624594, "revid": 1185602317, "title": "Krypton", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krypton"}, {"pageid": 34139, "revid": 1185603188, "title": "Xenon", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenon"}, {"pageid": 25604, "revid": 1185604788, "title": "Radon", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radon"}], "categories": ["Chemistry"]}}

He gained worldwide fame for his double sprint victory in world record times at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, which made him the first person to hold both records since fully automatic time became mandatory.\n\nIn addition to his accomplishments in athletics, Bolt made a name for himself as a footballer. He trained with Australian A-League team Central Coast Mariners and played in a few friendly matches. However, he left the club in November 2018 and decided not to pursue a career in football in January 2019.\n\nBolt also ventured into music production. In July 2019, he made his debut as a dancehall music producer with the release of the Olympe Ros\u00e9 riddim. He followed up with another compilation called Immortal Riddim in November 2019. In early January 2021, Bolt released a single titled \"Living the Dream\" with his childhood friend and manager Nugent 'NJ' Walker.\n\nA documentary film based on the athletic life of Bolt, titled \"I Am Bolt\", was released on 28 November 2016 in the United Kingdom.

{"id": "d16bbff1da9bf363", "answer": "\"Avatar: The Way of Water\" is the sequel to James Cameron's 2009 film \"Avatar\". The film was highly anticipated and faced several delays before its release. The film's production was a massive undertaking, with James Cameron spending an entire year writing the script before deciding it wasn't 'subconscious' enough and starting over.\n\nThe film was a box office success, with a global opening of $441.6 million. It went on to become the 4th highest-grossing film of all time, surpassing \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\". The film was also praised by critics, with some calling it 'downright moving' and 'bigger, better' than the first movie.\n\nThe film's runtime was over three hours, a decision defended by Cameron who told those complaining about the length to 'get up and go pee'. The film was also notable for its visual effects, with the team creating over 1,065 delivery versions for theaters.\n\nThe film starred Zoe Salda\u00f1a and Cliff Curtis in lead roles, with Matt Gerald also returning to the Avatar world.

{"id": "f76cc048a65a1dab", "answer": "Pierre Agostini is a French experimental physicist and Emeritus professor at Ohio State University. He is known for his pioneering work in strong-field laser physics and attosecond science. He is especially known for the observation of above-threshold ionization and the invention of the reconstruction of attosecond beating by interference of two-photon transitions (RABBITT) technique for characterization of attosecond light pulses. He was jointly awarded the 2023 Nobel Prize in Physics.\n\nAgostini was born in Tunis, in the French protectorate of Tunisia, in 1941. He obtained his baccalaur\u00e9at at the Prytan\u00e9e national militaire school in 1959 in La Fl\u00e8che, France. He studied physics at Aix-Marseille University, where he subsequently received a B.Ed. degree in physics in 1961, and a M.A.S. degree in 1962. In 1968 he completed a doctoral degree there, on multilayer dielectric filters for the ultraviolet.\n\nAfter his doctorate, he became a researcher at CEA Saclay in 1969 and stayed there until 2002. During this time, Agostini worked in the lab of G\u00e9rard Mainfray and Claude Manus, where he researched on multiphoton ionization using the powerful lasers there. They are the first to observe above-threshold ionization in 1979 in xenon gas.\n\nIn 2001, Agostini and his team at CEA Saclay along with Harm Geert Muller at the Dutch Foundation for Fundamental Research on Matter (FOM), using an advanced laser at the Laboratoire d'Optique Appliqu\u00e9e, managed to create a train of pulses each 250 attoseconds in duration. By recombining the ultrashort ultraviolet pulses with the original infrared light they created an interference effect that allowed him to characterize the length and repetition rate of the pulses.\n\nAgostini was a visiting scientist at the Brookhaven National Laboratory in the U.S. state of New York between 2002 and 2004, where he worked in Louis F. DiMauro's group. He became professor of physics at Ohio State University (OSU) in 2005 and ran a laboratory jointly with Louis F. DiMauro who moved a year earlier to OSU. Agostini became Emeritus professor at OSU in 2018.\n\nIn 2023, he received the Nobel Prize in Physics for \"for experimental methods that generate attosecond pulses of light for the study of electron dynamics in matter\" along with Anne L'Huillier and Ferenc Krausz.", "question": {"id": "f76cc048a65a1dab", "question": "Where did the laureates of the 2023 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, Physics and Chemistry get their PhD degrees?", "necessary_evidence": [{"pageid": 1175987, "revid": 1182266628, "title": "List of Nobel laureates", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nobel_laureates"}, {"pageid": 63780788, "revid": 1185392745, "title": "Katalin Karik\u00f3", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katalin_Karik%C3%B3"}, {"pageid": 66320318, "revid": 1185393239, "title": "Drew Weissman", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drew_Weissman"}, {"pageid": 74968668, "revid": 1179522028, "title": "Pierre Agostini", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Agostini"}, {"pageid": 4376617, "revid": 1184335443, "title": "Ferenc Krausz", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferenc_Krausz"}, {"pageid": 42629262, "revid": 1182792728, "title": "Anne L'Huillier", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_L%27Huillier"}, {"pageid": 53935928, "revid": 1184078201, "title": "Moungi Bawendi", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moungi_Bawendi"}, {"pageid": 17655280, "revid": 1183938536, "title": "Louis E.

{"id": "044ef3667b5585f0", "answer": "Takaaki Kajita is a Japanese physicist known for his experiments on neutrinos at the Kamioka Observatory \u2013 Kamiokande and its successor, Super-Kamiokande. He was born on March 9, 1959, in Higashimatsuyama, Saitama, Japan. He studied physics at Saitama University and graduated in 1981. He received his doctorate in 1986 at the University of Tokyo. \n\nIn 1998, Kajita's team at the Super-Kamiokande found that when cosmic rays hit the Earth's atmosphere, the resulting neutrinos switched between two flavors before they reached the detector under Mt. Kamioka. This discovery helped prove the existence of neutrino oscillation and that neutrinos have mass. \n\nIn 2015, Kajita shared the Nobel Prize in Physics with Canadian physicist Arthur McDonald, whose Sudbury Neutrino Observatory discovered similar results. Kajita's and McDonald's work solved the longstanding Solar neutrino problem, which was a major discrepancy between the predicted and measured Solar neutrino fluxes, and indicated that the Standard Model, which required neutrinos to be massless, had weaknesses.\n\nSince 1988, Kajita has been at the Institute for Cosmic Radiation Research, University of Tokyo, where he became an assistant professor in 1992 and professor in 1999. He became director of the Center for Cosmic Neutrinos at the Institute for Cosmic Ray Research (ICRR) in 1999.

He is the founder, chairman, and CEO of LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the world's largest luxury goods company. As of October 2023, his estimated net worth is US$187.6 billion, making him one of the wealthiest people in the world.\n\nArnault and his family had an estimated peak net worth of US$240.7 billion in April 2023, according to Forbes. This made him the richest person in the world at the time, surpassing Elon Musk. However, Musk would surpass Arnaut in June 2023 in net worth with $240 billion, as Arnault's wealth dropped to $190 billion.\n\nUnder Arnault's leadership, LVMH has grown to become the largest company by market capitalization in the eurozone, with a record of 313 billion euros ($382 billion) as of May 2021. Arnault has promoted decisions toward decentralizing the group's brands as a business strategy. As a result of these measures, brands under the LVMH umbrella such as Tiffany are still viewed as independent firms with their history.\n\nArnault has said that brands like Louis Vuitton and Dior are successful because \"they have these two aspects, which may be contradictory: They are timeless, [and] they are at the utmost level of modernity.\u201d\n\nIn 2013, it was disclosed that Arnault planned to apply for Belgian citizenship and was considering moving to Belgium. In April 2013, Arnault said that he had been misquoted and that he never intended to leave France: \"I repeatedly said that I would stay as a resident in France and that I would continue to pay my taxes... Today, I decided to remove any ambiguity. I withdraw my request for Belgian nationality.

The president is the head of state, while the prime minister of Iceland serves as the head of government in a multi-party system. Executive power is exercised by the government. Legislative power is vested in both the government and the parliament, the Althingi. The judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature.\n\nThe current President of Iceland is Gu\u00f0ni Thorlacius J\u00f3hannesson and the current Prime Minister is Katr\u00edn Jakobsd\u00f3ttir. The prime minister and cabinet exercise most executive functions. The cabinet is appointed by the president after general elections to Althing. However, this process is usually conducted by the leaders of the political parties, who decide among themselves after discussions which parties can form the cabinet and how its seats are to be distributed.\n\nAfter the 2008 financial crisis, there has been an increasing fractionalization of the Icelandic party system. The increase in the number of parties has made it harder for coalition governments to form. The last parliamentary elections took place on September 25, 2021. A three-party coalition was formed following the 2017 parliamentary elections by the Independence Party, the Progressive Party, and the Left-Green Movement.

{"id": "1620f02f078d4973", "answer": "Germany, officially known as the Federal Republic of Germany, is a country located in the western region of Central Europe. It is the second-most populous country in Europe after Russia and the most populous member state of the European Union. Germany is situated between the Baltic and North seas to the north, and the Alps to the south. It shares its borders with Denmark to the north, Poland and the Czech Republic to the east, Austria and Switzerland to the south, and France, Luxembourg, Belgium, and the Netherlands to the west. The nation's capital and most populous city is Berlin, and its main financial centre is Frankfurt. The largest urban area is the Ruhr.\n\nThe term \"Germany\" derives from the Latin \"Germania\", which was used by Julius Caesar for the peoples east of the Rhine. The German term \"Deutschland\" is derived from \"deutsch\", descended from Old High German \"diutisc\" meaning 'of the people'. This term was originally used to distinguish the language of the common people from Latin and its Romance descendants.\n\nGermany has a rich history, with significant events such as the Protestant Reformation incited by Martin Luther in 1517, the revolutions of 1848, the Weimar Republic and Nazi Germany, and the division and subsequent reunification of East and West Germany.

{"id": "789d805e9ab388ed", "answer": "The **Jack Russell Terrier** is a British breed of small terrier. It is principally white-bodied and smooth-, rough- or broken-coated, and can be any color. It derives from dogs bred and used for fox-hunting in North Devon in the early nineteenth century by a country parson, Jack Russell \u2013 for whom the breed is named \u2013 and has similar origins to the modern Fox Terrier. Though closely similar, it is a distinct and different breed from the Parson Russell Terrier.\n\nThe Jack Russell should always appear balanced and alert. The red fox is the traditional quarry of the Jack Russell terrier, so the working Jack Russell must be small enough to pursue it. Red foxes vary in size, but across the world, they average from 6\u20138\u00a0kg (13\u201317\u00a0lb) in weight and have an average chest size of 30\u201336\u00a0cm (12\u201314\u00a0in) at the widest part.\n\nThe **Chihuahua** is a Mexican breed of toy dog. It is named for the Mexican state of Chihuahua and is among the smallest of all dog breeds. It is usually kept as a companion animal or for showing. Chihuahuas are the smallest breed recognized by some kennel clubs. Current breed standards defined by registries specify an \"apple-head\" or \"apple-dome\" skull conformation.

{"id": "fe01464c12adaa71", "answer": "The population of the United States has been growing at a slower rate than in any other year since the country's founding. In 2021, the U.S. population grew only 0.1% from the previous year. The United States' population has grown by less than one million people for the first time since 1937, with the lowest numeric growth since at least 1900, when the Census Bureau began yearly population estimates. Slower population growth has been the norm in the United States for some years, owing to lower fertility and net international migration, as well as rising mortality from an aging population.\n\nThe country's racial profile will be vastly different by 2055 according to Pew Research Center. Growth in the Hispanic and Asian populations is predicted to almost triple over the next 40 years. By 2055, the breakdown is estimated to be 48% non-Hispanic white, 24% Hispanic, 16% Black, and 14% Asian.\n\nAs of 2015, 14% of the United States' population is foreign-born, compared to just 5% in 1965. Nearly 39 million immigrants have come to the U.S. since 1965, with most coming from Asia and Latin America. The 2015 Census Report predicts that the percentage of the U.S. population that is foreign-born will continue to increase, reaching 19% by 2060. This increase in the foreign-born population will account for a large share of the overall population growth.\n\nAccording to statistical data made by the Pew Research Center in 2021 about 63% of the US population is Christian, 28% is Unaffiliated, 2% is Jewish, 1% follows Buddhism, 1% follows Hinduism, 1% follows Islam and 2% follow traditional religions and others. Currently, the United States has the largest Christian population in the world (approximately 230-250 million) and the largest Protestant Christian population (approximately 150-160 million). The country also has the second largest Jewish community in the world (after Israel) and the largest Buddhist and Hindu communities in the West, as well as the largest number of followers of Islam in North America.

Traditionally known as the 'City of Filial Piety', today Suwon retains a variety of historical features.

The army was withdrawn, however, after news reached the commander that the city had already been sacked.

On the Second Circuit, Sotomayor heard appeals in more than 3,000 cases and wrote about 380 opinions. Sotomayor has taught at the New York University School of Law and Columbia Law School.\n\nIn May 2009, President Barack Obama nominated Sotomayor to the Supreme Court following the retirement of Justice David Souter. Her nomination was confirmed by the Senate in August 2009 by a vote of 68\u201331. Sotomayor has supported, while on the court, the informal liberal bloc of justices when they divide along the commonly perceived ideological lines. During her tenure on the Supreme Court, Sotomayor has been identified with concern for the rights of defendants, calls for reform of the criminal justice system, and making impassioned dissents on issues of race, gender and ethnic identity.", "question": {"id": "846ececb725e0d33", "question": "Who are the current female members of the US Supreme Court and from which schools did they receive their JD degrees?", "necessary_evidence": [{"pageid": 216429, "revid": 1180184921, "title": "List of justices of the Supreme Court of the United States", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_justices_of_the_Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States"}, {"pageid": 2095829, "revid": 1178458812, "title": "Sonia Sotomayor", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonia_Sotomayor"}, {"pageid": 2093225, "revid": 1180044509, "title": "Elena Kagan", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elena_Kagan"}, {"pageid": 53992581, "revid": 1184345665, "title": "Amy Coney Barrett", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Coney_Barrett"}, {"pageid": 23741955, "revid": 1185494927, "title": "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketanji_Brown_Jackson"}], "categories": ["Politics", "Law"]}}

Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability and ease of use, with its notable use of significant whitespace.\n\nPython has a wide range of applications, including web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and more. It is known for its extensive standard library, as well as the wealth of third-party packages available for it.\n\nPython's syntax is simple and expressive, allowing developers to write programs with fewer lines than would be possible in languages such as C++ or Java. Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.\n\nPython's built-in data types include booleans, integers, floating-point numbers, strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets. Python also provides powerful features such as list comprehensions, generators, exception handling, and more.\n\nPython has a strong presence in the scientific computing community, thanks to packages such as NumPy, SciPy, and pandas. It is also widely used in web development, with frameworks such as Django and Flask.\n\nPython's development is conducted largely through the Python Enhancement Proposal (PEP) process, which is the primary mechanism for proposing major new features, collecting community input on issues, and documenting Python design decisions.\n\nPython has consistently ranked in the top ten most popular programming languages in the TIOBE Programming Community Index.

As soon as the Baby had demonstrated the feasibility of its design, a project was initiated at the university to develop it into a full scale operational machine, the Manchester Mark 1. The Mark 1 in turn quickly became the prototype for the Ferranti Mark 1, the world's first commercially available general-purpose computer.

{"id": "0e70163df3274ee0", "answer": "Ivanka Trump is an American businesswoman and former reality TV personality who is the daughter of former U.S. President Donald Trump. She served as an advisor to her father during his presidency. Prior to her political career, she was an executive vice president of the family-owned Trump Organization. She also had her own line of Ivanka Trump fashion items, including clothes, handbags, shoes, and accessories, which was available in major U.S. department stores. Her brand was criticized for allegedly copying designs by other designers, and by PETA and other animal rights activists for using fur from rabbits. In 2016, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission recalled \"Ivanka Trump\"-branded scarves because they did not meet federal flammability standards. A 2016 Fair Labor Association inspection found that, in one factory in China where her products were made, workers were in excessive overtime, were being paid less than China's legal minimum wage, were mishandled, and were being subjected to verbal abuse and discrimination. In July 2018, Trump announced that she shut her company after deciding to pursue a career in public policy instead of returning to her fashion business.\n\nDuring her father's presidency, Trump transformed from a liberal to an \"unapologetically\" pro-life, \"proud Trump Republican\". In 2010, Trump co-founded Girl Up with the United Nations Foundation. The program encourages American girls to become forces of global change.\n\nIn 2012, the Wharton Club of New York gave Trump the Joseph Wharton Award for Young Leadership. In 2015, she was honored as a Young Global Leader by the World Economic Forum.

It is the fourth installment of the Fire Emblem series, and the second to be developed for the platform. The game takes place on the continent of Jugdral, split between eight countries founded by the Twelve Crusaders, an ancient group of soldiers who ended the rule of the ancient dragon Loptous with divine aid. The story is told over two generations\u2014the first generation follows the Grannvalian prince Sigurd, while the second follows his son Seliph as he works to defeat the cult and avenge his father.

The returning staff included series creator Shouzou Kaga, who acted as director, designer, and scenario writer; composer Yuka Tsujiyoko, who had handled all previous entries in the series; and Nintendo producer Gunpei Yokoi. The character design was handled primarily by Katsuyoshi Koya, with additional work done by Mayumi Hirota.\n\n\"Fire Emblem: Genealogy of the Holy War\" was released on May 14, 1996. It was subsequently ported to other platforms through Nintendo's Virtual Console. It was released for the Wii on January 30, 2007; for the Wii U on April 27, 2013; and August 27, 2016, for the New Nintendo 3DS.

{"id": "9d1131c0f1a4f4ae", "answer": "Kenyon Lee Martin Sr. is a former professional basketball player from America who played 15 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA). He was born on December 30, 1977, in Saginaw, Michigan. Martin played as a power forward for the New Jersey Nets, Denver Nuggets, Los Angeles Clippers, New York Knicks, and Milwaukee Bucks of the NBA, and the Xinjiang Flying Tigers of China. He played college basketball for the Cincinnati Bearcats and was named the national college player of the year during his senior season. Martin was drafted with the first overall pick in the 2000 NBA draft by the New Jersey Nets. He was an NBA All-Star in 2004.\n\nMartin remains the Bearcats' all-time leader in career blocked shots (292) and field goal percentage (.586). Cincinnati retired his #4 jersey on April 25, 2000. Later that year, he was selected first overall in the 2000 NBA draft by the New Jersey Nets. As of 2019, Martin remains the last American-born college senior to have been the top overall pick.\n\nIn the 2004 NBA All-Star Game, Martin scored 17 points, grabbed 7 rebounds, and had 3 assists. At the end of the 2003\u201304 season, Martin was traded to the Denver Nuggets for three future first-round draft picks in a sign-and-trade deal. Martin became an unrestricted free agent in the summer of 2011; however, due to the 2011 NBA lockout, he opted to sign a one-year contract with the Xinjiang Flying Tigers of the Chinese Basketball Association. His contract reportedly would have made him the highest-paid player in the Chinese league's history. On February 3, 2012, Martin signed with the Los Angeles Clippers. On February 21, 2013, Martin agreed to join the New York Knicks on a 10-day contract, which reunited him with Jason Kidd. On January 9, 2015, Martin signed a 10-day contract with the Milwaukee Bucks. Martin's final NBA game was on February 2, 2015, in a 82\u201375 win over the Toronto Raptors where Martin recorded 4 points and 3 rebounds.

{"id": "eb74f6ef8d698cac", "answer": "Meningioma, also known as a meningeal tumor, is typically a slow-growing tumor that forms from the meninges, the membranous layers surrounding the brain and spinal cord. Symptoms depend on the location and occur as a result of the tumor pressing on nearby tissue. Many cases never produce symptoms. Occasionally seizures, dementia, trouble talking, vision problems, one-sided weakness, or loss of bladder control may occur.\n\nRisk factors include exposure to ionizing radiation such as during radiation therapy, a family history of the condition, and neurofibromatosis type 2. They appear to be able to form from a number of different types of cells including arachnoid cells. Diagnosis is typically by medical imaging.\n\nIf there are no symptoms, periodic observation may be all that is required. Most cases that result in symptoms can be cured by surgery. Following complete removal fewer than 20% recur. If surgery is not possible or all the tumor cannot be removed, radiosurgery may be helpful. Chemotherapy has not been found to be useful. A small percentage grow rapidly and are associated with worse outcomes.\n\nAbout one per thousand people in the United States are currently affected. Onset is usually in adults. In this group, they represent about 30% of brain tumors. Women are affected about twice as often as men.

Disputes between Great Britain and the colonies led to the American Revolutionary War. On July 4, 1776, delegates from the 13 colonies unanimously adopted the Declaration of Independence. The war ended in 1783 with recognition of the independence of the United States by Great Britain, and was the first successful war of independence against a European colonial empire. The United States constitution was adopted on September 17, 1787; its ratification the following year made the states part of a single republic with a strong central government.\n\nThe United States has a mixed economy and has maintained a stable overall GDP growth rate, a moderate unemployment rate, and high levels of research and capital investment.

{"id": "0b6e09ed0ed4354a", "answer": "James Alexander Maynard is a British mathematician known for his work in analytic number theory, particularly the theory of prime numbers. He was born on June 10, 1987, in Chelmsford, Essex, England. He completed his bachelor's and master's degrees at Queens' College, University of Cambridge, and his DPhil at Balliol College, Oxford.\n\nMaynard has made significant contributions to the field of mathematics. In 2013, he provided a different proof of Yitang Zhang's theorem that there are bounded gaps between primes. He also resolved a longstanding conjecture by showing that for any given number, there are infinitely many intervals of bounded length containing that number of prime numbers. This work is seen as progress on the Hardy\u2013Littlewood conjecture.\n\nIn 2014, Maynard was awarded the SASTRA Ramanujan Prize. He has also received the Whitehead Prize (2015), the EMS Prize (2016), the Cole Prize (2020), and the Fields Medal (2022). In 2023, he was awarded the New Horizons in Mathematics Prize and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society.\n\nMaynard's personal life includes his partner, Eleanor Grant, a medical doctor, and their son.", "question": {"id": "0b6e09ed0ed4354a", "question": "Of the most recent Fields medalists, how many of them were born in Essex, England?", "necessary_evidence": [{"pageid": 10859, "revid": 1185485610, "title": "Fields Medal", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fields_Medal"}, {"pageid": 57492975, "revid": 1162846328, "title": "Hugo Duminil-Copin", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_Duminil-Copin"}, {"pageid": 54434626, "revid": 1173094504, "title": "June Huh", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/June_Huh"}, {"pageid": 50004967, "revid": 1178594961, "title": "Maryna Viazovska", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryna_Viazovska"}, {"pageid": 42512102, "revid": 1180117556, "title": "James Maynard (mathematician)", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Maynard_(mathematician)"}], "categories": ["Mathematics", "Geography"]}}

This includes actors who officially auditioned for the film producers and those who were unofficially supported by fans and celebrities. \n\nSome notable actors who were considered but not chosen include:\n\n- Trevor Howard for \"Dr. No\" in 1961. He was first considered by Kevin McClory for the abandoned \"Longitude 78 West\" film project, which was later revamped into the novel \"Thunderball\". Ian Fleming disagreed feeling Howard, at 43 years, was too old for the role. He was again considered by Albert R. Broccoli for \"Dr. No\".\n- Stanley Baker who would not commit to a three-picture contract.\n- Rex Harrison who was turned down in favor of Connery.\n- David Niven who was turned down in favor of Connery (later played Bond in the 1967 parody \"Casino Royale\") (Fleming's personal choice).\n- Richard Todd who was Ian Fleming's first choice for the role, but scheduling conflicts prevented him from getting it.\n- Jeremy Brett for \"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\" in 1967. He feared the role would harm his career.\n\nActors who were considered but declined the role include:\n\n- Timothy Dalton who was offered the role in 1967 at the age of 21 and finally took the role 20 years later. Dalton declined the offer again in 1979 because he felt the plot directions of the Bond films were becoming less realistic and more dependent on gadgetry and repeated plot formulas.\n- Michael Caine who did not want to be typecast in spy films, having previously starred in the three Harry Palmer spy films.\n\nActors who were considered for the role of James Bond, but were cast as supporting or opposing characters include:\n\n- George Baker for \"Dr. No\" in 1961. He played Sir Hillary Bray in \"On Her Majesty\u2019s Secret Service\" (1969) and Captain Benson in \"The Spy Who Loved Me\" (1977).\n- Michael Billington for \"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\", \"Live and Let Die\", \"Moonraker\", \"For Your Eyes Only\", \"Octopussy\".

The states and territories included in the United States Census Bureau's statistics for the United States population, ethnicity, religion, and most other categories include the 50 states and Washington, D.C. Separate statistics are maintained for the five permanently inhabited territories of the United States: Puerto Rico, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands.\n\nAs of the 2010 United States Census, the nine most populous U.S. states contain slightly more than half of the total population. The 25 least populous states contain less than one-sixth of the total population. California, the most populous state, contains more people than the 21 least populous states combined, and Wyoming, the least populous state, has a population less than any of the 31 most populous U.S. cities.\n\nThe United States Census counts the persons residing in the United States including citizens, non-citizen permanent residents and non-citizen long-term visitors. Civilian and military federal employees serving abroad and their dependents are counted in their home state.\n\nEvery 10 years, the U.S. Census Bureau is charged with making an actual count of all residents by state and territory. The accuracy of this count is then tested after the fact, and sometimes statistically significant undercounts or overcounts occur. For example, for the 2020 decennial census, 14 states had significant miscounts ranging from 1.5% to 6.6%. While these adjustments may be reflected in government programs over the following decade, the 10-year representative apportionments discussed below are not changed to reflect the miscount.\n\nThe Electoral College, every four years, elects the President and Vice President of the United States based on the popular vote in each state and the District of Columbia.

The film made extensive use of new motion capture filming techniques and was released for traditional viewing, 3D viewing (using the RealD 3D, Dolby 3D, XpanD 3D, and IMAX 3D formats), and for \"4D\" experiences in select South Korean theaters.\n\n\"Avatar\" was acclaimed by audiences and critics, who praised its groundbreaking visual effects. It grossed over $2.7 billion, becoming the highest-grossing film at the time, a record it held for a decade until \"Avengers: Endgame\" surpassed it in 2019. It was nominated for nine Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director, and won three, for Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, and Best Visual Effects. The success of the film also led to electronics manufacturers releasing 3D televisions and caused 3D films to increase in popularity.", "question": {"id": "54a8207247611e05", "question": "What are the top 5 highest grossing movies, and what are their running times, in minutes?", "necessary_evidence": [{"pageid": 59892, "revid": 1185890055, "title": "List of highest-grossing films", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-grossing_films"}, {"pageid": 4273140, "revid": 1185356274, "title": "Avatar (2009 film)", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar_(2009_film)"}, {"pageid": 44254295, "revid": 1185724642, "title": "Avengers: Endgame", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avengers:_Endgame"}, {"pageid": 25813358, "revid": 1185376874, "title": "Avatar: The Way of Water", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar:_The_Way_of_Water"}, {"pageid": 52371, "revid": 1185400166, "title": "Titanic (1997 film)", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanic_(1997_film)"}, {"pageid": 14723194, "revid": 1185889585, "title": "Star Wars: The Force Awakens", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_The_Force_Awakens"}], "categories": ["Film Studies"]}}

The American edition was published in September 1998 under the title \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\". \n\nThe story revolves around Harry Potter, an orphan who is a \"scrawny, black-haired, green-eyed and bespectacled boy who didn't know he was a wizard.\" The events of this book take place just before and in the year following Harry's eleventh birthday. Voldemort's attack left a lightning bolt-shaped scar on Harry's forehead, which produces stabbing pains whenever Voldemort is present. Harry has a natural talent for Quidditch and became the first person in a century to get on their team in their first year.\n\nThe book won two publishing industry awards given for sales rather than literary merit, the British Book Awards Children's Book of the Year and the Booksellers' Association / Bookseller Author of the Year. By March 1999 UK editions had sold just over 300,000 copies and the story was still the UK's best-selling title in December 2001.

However, his tenure has also been marked by controversies and criticisms, including ethics investigations and allegations of blackface incidents.\n\nTrudeau's political career began with his election to the House of Commons in 2008. He served as the Liberal Party's critic for Youth and Multiculturalism, Citizenship and Immigration, and Post Secondary Education, Youth and Amateur Sport. In 2013, he was elected leader of the Liberal Party, and in 2015, his party won a majority in the House of Commons, making him Prime Minister.\n\nTrudeau's leadership has been marked by a focus on social issues and the environment. He is known for his stance on issues such as climate change, gender equality, and Indigenous rights.

It exercises jurisdiction over 22 provinces, five autonomous regions, four direct-controlled municipalities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing), and the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau.\n\nChina emerged as one of the world's first civilizations, in the fertile basin of the Yellow River in the North China Plain. For millennia, China's political system was based on absolute hereditary monarchies, or dynasties, beginning with the semi-mythical Xia dynasty in 21st century BCE. Since then, China has expanded, fractured, and re-unified numerous times. In the 3rd century BCE, the Qin reunited core China and established the first Chinese empire. The succeeding Han dynasty saw some of the most advanced technology at that time, including papermaking and the compass, along with agricultural and medical improvements.\n\nThe introduction of railroads in the late 19th century led to an integrated economy. Contemporary China is a global hub for manufacturing, and is the largest manufacturing economy and exporter of goods in the world. It is also the world's fastest-growing consumer market and second-largest importer of goods. China is a net importer of services products. It is the largest trading nation in the world and plays a vital role in international trade, and has increasingly engaged in trade organizations and treaties in recent years.

{"id": "3e79b4cb2cd458c9", "answer": "The Beatles were an English rock band formed in Liverpool in 1960. The group, whose best-known line-up comprised John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, are regarded as the most influential band of all time. They were integral to the development of 1960s counterculture and popular music's recognition as an art form. Rooted in skiffle, beat and 1950s rock and roll, their sound incorporated elements of classical music and traditional pop in innovative ways; the band later explored music styles ranging from ballads and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock. As pioneers in recording, songwriting and artistic presentation, the Beatles revolutionised many aspects of the music industry and were often publicised as leaders of the era's youth and sociocultural movements.\n\nThe Beatles' influence on popular culture was significant. They led the mid-1960s musical \"British Invasion\" into the United States. Although their initial musical style was rooted in 1950s rock and roll and homegrown skiffle, the group explored genres ranging from Tin Pan Alley to psychedelic rock. Their clothes, styles, and statements made them trend-setters, while their growing social awareness saw their influence extend into the social and cultural revolutions of the 1960s.\n\nThe Beatles are the best-selling music act of all time, with certified sales of over 183 million units in the US and estimated sales of 600 million units worldwide. They hold the record for most number-one albums on the UK Albums Chart, most number-one hits on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, and most singles sold in the UK. The group were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988, and all four main members were inducted individually between 1994 and 2015. In 2008, the group topped Billboard's list of the all-time most successful artists on the Billboard Hot 100.

{"id": "e8200151f579bdf9", "answer": "The Monarchy of Canada is the institution at the core of Canada's constitutional federal structure and Westminster-style parliamentary democracy. The monarchy is the foundation of the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of both federal and provincial jurisdictions. The sovereign is the personification of the Canadian state and is Queen of Canada as a matter of constitutional law. The current monarch is Queen Elizabeth II, who has reigned since February 6, 1952. Elizabeth's eldest son, Charles, Prince of Wales, is heir apparent.\n\nAlthough the person of the sovereign is shared with 15 other independent countries within the Commonwealth of Nations, each country's monarchy is separate and legally distinct. As a result, the current monarch is officially titled Queen of Canada and, in this capacity, she, her consort, and other members of the Canadian Royal Family undertake public and private functions domestically and abroad as representatives of Canada. However, the Queen is the only member of the Royal Family with any constitutional role.\n\nThe Canadian monarch, besides reigning in Canada, separately serves as monarch for each of 15 other Commonwealth realms. This developed from the former colonial relationship between these countries and the United Kingdom, but they are now independent of each other. This means that in practice, the monarch has 16 separate, independent monarchical roles. The monarchy thus ceased to be an exclusively British institution, although it has often been called \"British\" since this time (in both legal and common language) for reasons historical, legal, and of convenience. The Royal and viceroyal figures may unilaterally use these powers in exceptional constitutional crisis situations. Politicians can sometimes try to use to their favour the complexity of the relationship between the monarch, viceroy, ministers, and parliament, and the public's general unfamiliarity with it.", "question": {"id": "e8200151f579bdf9", "question": "Which of the current G7 countries have constitutional monarchies and who are their reigning monarchs?", "necessary_evidence": [{"pageid": 1196634, "revid": 1185575195, "title": "G7", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G7"}, {"pageid": 5042916, "revid": 1185732441, "title": "Canada", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada"}, {"pageid": 31717, "revid": 1185578678, "title": "United Kingdom", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"}, {"pageid": 15573, "revid": 1185720931, "title": "Japan", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"}, {"pageid": 5843419, "revid": 1185856656, "title": "France", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France"}, {"pageid": 11867, "revid": 1185869364, "title": "Germany", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany"}, {"pageid": 14532, "revid": 1185928833, "title": "Italy", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy"}, {"pageid": 3434750, "revid": 1185914171, "title": "United States", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"}], "categories": ["History", "Political Science"]}}

{"id": "6f0332aa289e10b1", "answer": "Camelids are members of the biological family Camelidae, the only currently living family in the suborder Tylopoda. The seven extant members of this group are: dromedary camels, Bactrian camels, wild Bactrian camels, llamas, alpacas, vicu\u00f1as, and guanacos. Camelids are even-toed ungulates classified in the order Artiodactyla, along with species including whales, pigs, deer, cattle, and antelopes.\n\nCamelids are large, strictly herbivorous animals with slender necks and long legs. They differ from ruminants in a number of ways. Their dentition show traces of vestigial central incisors in the incisive bone, and the third incisors have developed into canine-like tusks. Camelids also have true canine teeth and tusk-like premolars, which are separated from the molars by a gap. As in ruminants, the upper incisors are largely absent and are replaced by a dental pad consisting of connective tissue covered with epithelium.\n\nCamelids do not have hooves; rather, they have two-toed feet with toenails and soft foot pads. Most of the weight of the animal rests on these tough, leathery sole pads. The South American camelids have adapted to the steep and rocky terrain by adjusting the pads on their toes to maintain grip.\n\nCamelids are unusual in that their modern distribution is almost the inverse of their area of origin. Camelids first appeared very early in the evolution of the even-toed ungulates, around 50 to 40 million years ago during the middle Eocene, in present-day North America. Among the earliest camelids was the rabbit-sized Protylopus, which still had four toes on each foot. By the late Eocene, around 35 million years ago, camelids such as Poebrotherium had lost the two lateral toes, and were about the size of a modern goat.\n\nCamelids are behaviorally similar in many ways, including their walking gait, in which both legs on the same side are moved simultaneously. While running, camelids engage a unique \"running pace gait\" in which limbs on the same side move in the same pattern they walk, with both left legs moving and then both right, which ensures that the fore and hind limb will not collide while in fast motion. During this motion, all four limbs momentarily are off the ground at the same time. Consequently, camelids large enough for human beings to ride have a typical swaying motion.\n\nDromedary camels, bactrian camels, llamas, and alpacas are all induced ovulators. The three Afro-Asian camel species have developed extensive adaptations to their lives in harsh, near-waterless environments. Wild populations of the Bactrian camel are even able to drink brackish water, and some herds live in nuclear test areas.", "question": {"id": "6f0332aa289e10b1", "question": "List all pseudoruminant animals, also known as animals with three-chambered stomachs, along with their conservation status.", "necessary_evidence": [{"pageid": 17244863, "revid": 1167812497, "title": "Pseudoruminant", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoruminant"}, {"pageid": 37764, "revid": 1183640753, "title": "Hippopotamus", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippopotamus"}, {"pageid": 13645, "revid": 1185518338, "title": "Horse", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse"}, {"pageid": 802149, "revid": 1184583020, "title": "Indian rhinoceros", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rhinoceros"}, {"pageid": 24556191, "revid": 1185321642, "title": "European rabbit", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_rabbit"}], "categories": ["Zoology", "Biology"]}}

In 1889, the dates were change to be on even-numbered years, with the term extending to two years per term; the first election in an even-numbered year was in 1892. In 1909, the city charter changed the election years to odd-numbered years with the March 1909 election, originally slated to be a recall election against Arthur C. Harper. In 1993, voters amended the city charter to implement term limits to elected officials, including mayor. In 2015, voters passed a charter amendment that would change the election dates to align with gubernatorial and presidential elections on even-numbered years; the first mayoral election after this change was in 2022.", "question": {"id": "2708fe669c1414da", "question": "In what years were the mayors of the two most populous cities in the United States born?", "necessary_evidence": [{"pageid": 1649321, "revid": 1185657569, "title": "List of United States cities by population", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_cities_by_population"}, {"pageid": 206327, "revid": 1183368828, "title": "Mayor of New York City", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor_of_New_York_City"}, {"pageid": 11149441, "revid": 1184952491, "title": "Eric Adams", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Adams"}, {"pageid": 357012, "revid": 1183925776, "title": "Mayor of Los Angeles", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor_of_Los_Angeles"}, {"pageid": 8722536, "revid": 1185512832, "title": "Karen Bass", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_Bass"}], "categories": ["History", "Politics"]}}

{"id": "025a127af28628f0", "answer": "In Switzerland, road traffic travels on the right-hand side, similar to most countries. This is in line with the general practice in most countries where rail traffic travels on the same side as road traffic. However, there are exceptions where railways built using left-hand traffic (LHT) British technology remained LHT despite their nations' road traffic becoming right-hand traffic (RHT). \n\nIn the late 18th century, right-hand traffic started to be introduced in the United States of America based on teamsters' use of large freight wagons pulled by several pairs of horses and without a driver's seat. The first keep-right law for driving in the United States was passed in 1792 and applied to the Philadelphia and Lancaster Turnpike. Today the United States is RHT except the United States Virgin Islands, which is LHT like many neighboring islands.\n\nIt's important to note that the direction of traffic can vary from country to country, and sometimes within different regions of the same country. For example, in Indonesia, it is the reverse (RHT for rails and LHT for roads). France is mainly LHT for trains except for the classic lines in Alsace\u2013Lorraine, which were converted from LHT to RHT under German administration from 1870 to 1918, along with most metro systems. China is primarily LHT for long-distance trains and RHT for metro systems. \n\nIn conclusion, when driving in Switzerland, you should drive on the right-hand side of the road.", "question": {"id": "025a127af28628f0", "question": "Identify the side of the road people drive on in the countries from which the first six winners of the Nobel Peace Prize hail.", "necessary_evidence": [{"pageid": 19835450, "revid": 1185465403, "title": "List of Nobel Peace Prize laureates", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nobel_Peace_Prize_laureates"}, {"pageid": 8087628, "revid": 1185276006, "title": "Egypt", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt"}, {"pageid": 5843419, "revid": 1185856656, "title": "France", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France"}, {"pageid": 31717, "revid": 1185578678, "title": "United Kingdom", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"}, {"pageid": 3343, "revid": 1185085425, "title": "Belgium", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium"}], "categories": ["History", "Politics", "Geography"]}}

{"id": "0f773d64e299ca38", "answer": "Brian Thomas Littrell, born on February 20, 1975, is an American singer and a member of the Backstreet Boys. He is also a contemporary Christian music artist and released the solo album \"Welcome Home\" in 2006. He is the father of country singer Baylee Littrell. Littrell was born in Lexington, Kentucky, to Jacqueline \"Jackie\" R. (n\u00e9e Fox), a dentist's secretary, and Harold Baker Littrell Jr, an IBM employee. He has an older brother Harold III, an actor and singer, and is the cousin of fellow Backstreet Boys member Kevin Richardson.\n\nAt 15, Littrell had aspirations to become a basketball player, but at 5 feet 7 inches (170 cm) he struggled with his height, and was seldom selected for high school tournaments. He aspired to become a music minister, but in April 1993 during a history class at Tates Creek, Littrell's cousin and future bandmate Kevin Richardson called him out of an American History class and informed him of an audition for a fifth member of the Backstreet Boys after a member spot opened up when Burk Parsons resigned his place in the group due to his desire to become a Christian minister. Littrell flew to Orlando the next day and finished high school via correspondence, graduating in 1994.\n\nIn 1997, Littrell was instrumental in bringing a lawsuit against the group's creator Lou Pearlman, claiming Pearlman had concealed information regarding the group's earnings. Bandmates AJ McLean, Richardson and Howie Dorough joined the lawsuit which eventually resulted in a number of settlements, details of which were not disclosed.\n\nLittrell was born with a congenital heart condition, making him susceptible to infections. He was diagnosed with a heart murmur at 6 weeks old. At 5 years old, he was hospitalized for two months due to a bacterial infection. Due to his hospitalization, Littrell was held back in school and had to repeat the first grade. In November 1997, doctors found his heart condition had caused his heart to enlarge considerably. Still, he underwent open-heart surgery on May 8, 1998. He later established the Brian Littrell Healthy Heart Club, a non-profit organization assisting children with heart conditions through medical, financial, and practical help. In October 2009, Littrell became infected with swine flu, causing the cancellation of the Backstreet Boys \"This Is Us\" promotional tour.", "question": {"id": "0f773d64e299ca38", "question": "What are the birth years of each member of the Backstreet Boys?", "necessary_evidence": [{"pageid": 11778870, "revid": 1185810158, "title": "Backstreet Boys", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backstreet_Boys"}, {"pageid": 675411, "revid": 1185434986, "title": "AJ McLean", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AJ_McLean"}, {"pageid": 155696, "revid": 1176475449, "title": "Howie Dorough", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howie_Dorough"}, {"pageid": 1358569, "revid": 1184989676, "title": "Nick Carter", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Carter_(singer)"}, {"pageid": 931758, "revid": 1179763387, "title": "Kevin Richardson (musician)", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Richardson_(musician)"}, {"pageid": 928764, "revid": 1178203548, "title": "Brian Littrell", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Littrell"}], "categories": ["Music", "Culture"]}}

{"id": "69f0461937e01a07", "answer": "The economy of Canada is a highly developed mixed economy, with the world's tenth-largest economy as of 2023, and a nominal GDP of approximately US$2.117 trillion. Canada is one of the world's largest trading nations, with a highly globalized economy. In 2021, Canadian trade in goods and services reached $2.016 trillion. Canada's exports totalled over $637 billion, while its imported goods were worth over $631 billion, of which approximately $391 billion originated from the United States. \n\nThe Canadian economic system generally combines elements of private enterprise and public enterprise. Many aspects of public enterprise, most notably the development of an extensive social welfare system to redress social and economic inequities, were adopted after the end of World War II in 1945. \n\nSince the early 20th century, the growth of Canada's manufacturing, mining, and service sectors has transformed the nation from a largely rural economy to an urbanized, industrial one. Like many other developed countries, the Canadian economy is dominated by the service industry, which employs about three-quarters of the country's workforce. \n\nCanada has a strong cooperative banking sector, with the world's highest per-capita membership in credit unions. It ranks low in the Corruption Perceptions Index (14th in 2023) and \"is widely regarded as among the least corrupt countries of the world\". It ranks high in the Global Competitiveness Report (14th in 2019) and Global Innovation Indexes (15th in 2022). \n\nThe United States is by far Canada's largest trading partner, with more than $1.7 billion CAD in trade per day in 2005. In 2009, 73% of Canada's exports went to the United States, and 63% of Canada's imports were from the United States. Trade with Canada makes up 23% of the United States' exports and 17% of its imports. \n\nCanada's economy ranks above most Western nations on The Heritage Foundation's Index of Economic Freedom and experiences a relatively low level of income disparity. The country's average household disposable income per capita is \"well above\" the OECD average. Canada ranks among the lowest of the most developed countries for housing affordability and foreign direct investment.", "question": {"id": "69f0461937e01a07", "question": "What are the GDPs (in billion USD) of the countries with the five longest coastlines?", "necessary_evidence": [{"pageid": 4147091, "revid": 1183773520, "title": "List of countries by length of coastline", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_length_of_coastline"}, {"pageid": 5195, "revid": 1185018628, "title": "Economy of Canada", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Canada"}, {"pageid": 57615, "revid": 1182585181, "title": "Economy of Norway", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Norway"}, {"pageid": 14647, "revid": 1185856359, "title": "Economy of Indonesia", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Indonesia"}, {"pageid": 25705, "revid": 1185002095, "title": "Economy of Russia", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Russia"}, {"pageid": 23445, "revid": 1185242321, "title": "Economy of the Philippines", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_Philippines"}], "categories": ["Economics", "Geography"]}}

{"id": "896ef3f2a5ef858e", "answer": "The University of Oxford is a prestigious institution known for its unique teaching method centred on tutorials, where 1\u20134 students spend an hour with an academic discussing their week's work. This could be an essay or problem sheet, depending on the subject. The university conducts examinations and confers degrees. Undergraduate teaching takes place during three eight-week academic terms: Michaelmas, Hilary and Trinity.\n\nThe students at the University of Oxford were traditionally associated based on geographical origins, into two 'nations', representing the North and the South. In later centuries, geographical origins continued to influence many students' affiliations when membership of a college or hall became customary in Oxford.\n\nFor graduate study, there are many scholarships available to students from all sorts of backgrounds, from Rhodes Scholarships to the relatively new Weidenfeld Scholarships. Oxford also offers the Clarendon Scholarship which is open to graduate applicants of all nationalities.\n\nA unique tradition at the university is 'Trashing', where students who just finished their last examination of the year are sprayed with alcohol, flour and confetti. Other traditions and customs vary by college. For example, some colleges have formal hall six times a week, but in others this only happens occasionally, or even not at all.\n\nDuring the First World War, many undergraduates and fellows joined the armed forces. By 1918 virtually all fellows were in uniform, and the student population in residence was reduced to 12 per cent of the pre-war total. The University Roll of Service records that, in total, 14,792 members of the university served in the war, with 2,716 (18.36%) killed.", "question": {"id": "896ef3f2a5ef858e", "question": "What are the founding years of the University of Bologna, University of Oxford, University of Cambridge, University of Salamanca, and University of Padua?", "necessary_evidence": [{"pageid": 363897, "revid": 1185805305, "title": "List of oldest universities in continuous operation", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_oldest_universities_in_continuous_operation"}, {"pageid": 263329, "revid": 1185930444, "title": "University of Bologna", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Bologna"}, {"pageid": 31797, "revid": 1185874759, "title": "University of Oxford", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Oxford"}, {"pageid": 25978572, "revid": 1184522407, "title": "University of Cambridge", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Cambridge"}, {"pageid": 579740, "revid": 1185931599, "title": "University of Salamanca", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Salamanca"}, {"pageid": 378253, "revid": 1184553165, "title": "University of Padua", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Padua"}], "categories": ["History", "Education"]}}

He started playing baseball at five years of age and entered Kyush\u016b Gakuin Integrated High School where he became their team's regular first baseman and cleanup hitter. He hit a total of 52 home runs in high school and his slugging prowess earned him the nickname \"Babe Ruth of Higo\", Higo being the former name of Kumamoto Prefecture.\n\nDespite not getting a lot of media exposure from appearances in national games, he was drafted in the first round of the 2017 NPB Draft by the Tokyo Yakult Swallows, Yomiuri Giants and the Rakuten Golden Eagles, as an alternative pick after they lost K\u014dtar\u014d Kiyomiya to the Nippon Ham Fighters. The Swallows won the lottery, and signed him for a contract of 80 million yen and a 7.2 million yen annual salary. He was assigned jersey number 55.\n\nIn 2022, Murakami hit his 56th home run of the season, breaking Oh's record for the most home runs by a Japanese-born player. He also became the first person who plays offense to win the NPB Triple Crown since Nobuhiko Matsunaka of the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks in 2004, and the first by a Central League player since Randy Bass of the Hanshin Tigers in 1986, and the youngest player to win the Triple Crown, at 22 years, eight months, and one day old at the conclusion of the 2022 regular season. He then proceeded to win the Central League MVP in a unanimous vote, becoming the first player since Masahiro Tanaka in 2013 and the first position player since Sadaharu Oh in 1977 to win the MVP ballot unanimously.\n\nAfter the 2022 season, Murakami signed a three-year contract extension worth 600 million yen per year, which stipulates that the Swallows must post Murakami to Major League Baseball after the 2025 season.", "question": {"id": "c68fe6d8fad6edcd", "question": "List the MVPs from the last five annual championship series in Nippon Professional Baseball who were left-handed (either batting, throwing, or both) and provide their current ages.", "necessary_evidence": [{"pageid": 147794, "revid": 1184003919, "title": "Nippon Professional Baseball", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nippon_Professional_Baseball"}, {"pageid": 379669, "revid": 1183816929, "title": "Japan Series", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan_Series"}, {"pageid": 60674335, "revid": 1185594315, "title": "K\u014dji Chikamoto", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C5%8Dji_Chikamoto"}, {"pageid": 68294396, "revid": 1180955236, "title": "Yutaro Sugimoto", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yutaro_Sugimoto"}, {"pageid": 41682809, "revid": 1179669059, "title": "Yuhei Nakamura", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuhei_Nakamura"}, {"pageid": 62208167, "revid": 1180951931, "title": "Ryoya Kurihara", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryoya_Kurihara"}, {"pageid": 53493861, "revid": 1181569564, "title": "Yurisbel Gracial", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yurisbel_Gracial"}], "categories": ["Sports", "Statistics"]}}

The poem was set to the tune of a popular British song written by John Stafford Smith for the Anacreontic Society, a men's social club in London. \"To Anacreon in Heaven\" (or \"The Anacreontic Song\"), with various lyrics, was already popular in the United States.\n\nThe song gained popularity throughout the 19th century and bands played it during public events, such as July 4th celebrations. A petition to the U.S. government to make \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" the national anthem began in 1916 and by the 1930s more than five million people had signed petitions urging Congress to adopt the song. In 1931, the song was officially designated as the U.S. national anthem by a congressional resolution signed by President Herbert Hoover.\n\nThe song is notoriously difficult for nonprofessionals to sing because of its wide range \u2013 a twelfth.
